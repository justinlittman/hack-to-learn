Even if a loss in a friend's family is not your own personal loss you can't help realizing what it means for them to lose a link which has been the center of a family chain.
Years ago I remember a friend saying to me that one of the hard things about growing older was the passing of what to you had been the older generation, suddenly you were standing out in front with no one to fall back on and give you a sense of security we all must meet this however, and there is always the joy of welcoming new youth to wipe out our sadness.
I went over and spent a while this morning with my new grand baby and her mother. Is there anything more exquisite than the softness of a wee baby's skin? Unfortunately her little sister 
                     Sarah
                   has had a cold and so has not as yet been able to see the new baby.
I stopped and bought Sara a toy and went in to tell her that I had see mummy and little Kate. SarahSara said, "I have heard about my sister, but I haven't seen her yet" and I wonder if when she does there won't be just a little bit of jealousy, for the new one always occupies the center of the stage for a time at least!
This seems to be a very family day for my daughter and I had lunch together and found ourselves discussing many things.
