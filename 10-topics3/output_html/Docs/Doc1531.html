                  —This Spring in New Bedford, Massachusetts , there will be a celebration in honor of the Girl Scouts. It will feature a preview of the film, "Women of Tomorrow," which tells the history of the Girl Scouts and shows them at work. Although there are no professionals taking part—rolls are played by the Girl Scouts—I hope every theatre in the nation will show this film. Everyone should see it.
I have always had great respect for Girl Scout programs of this country, and I am particularly interested in their international work.

I am sure many people were very much interested in the account given by Michael Shipkov, a Bulgarian, who explained how it was possible to make individuals confess treason in a Communist-dominated court, regardless of the truth. I am sorry to say that intimidation has been used in practically every country by some of its officials who felt it legitimate because they were trying to obtain some particular kind of testimony.
