                     new-york, Friday
                  â€”I have been getting up rather early the past few days. On Tuesday morning I left hyde-park by a 6:30 train in order to make the 10:20 plane for Raleigh, N.C., and on Thursday I left The Inn in Chapel Hill at 6:15 to make the 7:30 plane back to new-york City.
Nevertheless, I promised to tell you what I did while I was there, so here goes. My plane was an hour late on the way down because of foggy weather. Mrs. William B.

I was still answering the girls' questions when a contingent of boys arrived with the Dean of Men from Chapel Hill. We soon started on our drive to Chapel Hill. As I had a few minutes to spare on arrival, I went out to see Dr. and Mrs. Will Alexander at their farm. Dr. Alexander had been ill and for the first time had gone out to walk, so I missed him, and this was a real disappointment.
