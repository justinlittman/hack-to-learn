As it is, after the President goes up stairs,upstairs, I always go back into the dining room anddownand down the corridor to the East Room to have a look at those who are dancing and I really think it is possible for people to enjoy themselves.
This morning I am on the trail of a new "Scamper".Scamper." Our small grandson, Bill Roosevelt, who is staying here at the moment, has read and enjoyed both of my daughter's bookbooks about "Scamper" and every morning since his arrival he has demanded to know where Scamper can be found. We used to have bunnies in an enclosure at the back of the whitehouse, but the numbers of dogs in the whitehouse finally made it rather difficult to keep them safely apart.
