                     MEEKER, COLO.MEEKER, Colo.
                  â€”Last Friday morning we started off in two cars to go and look at a horse which Elliott decided to buy, subject to an examination by a vet. My daughter-in-law, Minnewa, was going on to Denver and my grandson, Bill, was taking a plane to newyork. Minnewa was to spend two days in Denver getting her son, Rexie, off to losangeles where he will be for a few weeks.
Elliott and I picked up the veterinarian in Meeker and soon the horse was examined and found sound. He certainly is a beautiful horse. We put him into the vet's horse trailer for the trip home, and those going to Denver proceeded on their way while we retraced our tracks.
A charming young woman who is to spend several weeks on the ranch, Miss Hart Hagin, was with us on the return drive. She has become almost a member of the household and now that Elliott's daughter, Chandler, has arrived, the two girls, being about the same age will enjoy each other's company.
The man and woman who sold my son the horse have a little girl, seven years old, who has had polio since she was three. She has had treatment in the Children's Hospital in Denver and did extremely well. Though at first she was paralyzed from the neck down, all except her two arms, she breathes perfectly now and her back is practically normal. The muscles of her stomach are normal, too, but her left leg is still badly paralyzed. Her right leg, I was told is much better than it was at first....</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(31%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>house told good beautiful place small land water summer looked</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(27%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>morning mrs afternoon back time yesterday night miss washington lunch</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(21%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>women work men young home war service boys day time</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(6%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>children people school education city program work country money community</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
