                     newyork.â€”Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion is a forceful gentleman and he is in a particularly fortunate position for himself, since he can resign with perfect ease and retire joyfully to his farm and know that the need for him will become apparent very quickly.
He has a quality of youth in spite of the number of his years and he has a drive and an inspiring spirit which makes him appealing to the youth of Israel. I don't think that he would be allowed to be off the public stage for long.
I am a believer in developing young people to follow in the steps of elder statesmen, but I also realize that until death removes the elder statesmen it is often difficult for the younger ones to show their real ability.
