                     WASHINGTON, Tuesday â€”Yesterday was a beautiful day in los-angeles and the sun shone on the small wedding party gathered at Mr. and Mrs. George Converse's house. Their drawing room was a bower of flowers and the lunch afterwards was served in their patio. What kind and considerate hosts they were! These California houses are enchanting for a party of this kind, and it was a party of real friends who were happy in each other's joy.

I boarded it a little after 4:30 and was delighted to find Mr. J. F. T. O'Connor seated opposite me.
