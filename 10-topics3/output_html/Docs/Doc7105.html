                     WASHINGTON, Tuesdayâ€”On Sunday evening a few of us went to the concert at the Water Gate, which was the first of a series of concerts given by the National Symphony Orchestra and led by Mr. Hans Kindler. The program Sunday night was dedicated to the united-nations.
In addition to the music, there was an informal pageant produced in cooperation with the Office of civilian-defense and the Office of Facts and Figures. Mr. Melvyn Douglas directed it and the script was written by Mr. Maxwell Anderson. I think everybody felt it was an appropriate and effective presentation for this occasion.
Our climate treated us to one ifof its sudden changes and a warm day became a cool and windy evening. However, it was certainly a lovely setting for beautiful music and I was happy to see the numbers of young people in canoes listening and enjoying the evening. We are becoming a musically appreciative nation, particularly in the younger generation.
I have been leading a rather uncertain existence due to the fact that other people's plans on which my own have to be dependent, have been rather changeable. Instead of reaching new-york City yesterday in time for lunch, I got there just in time for a reception at Holland House in celebration of Flag Day. It was sponsored by the National Council of Women and the Women's Society for a Free and Democratic Europe.
In the evening, I presided during the first part of a meeting held under the auspices of the French weekly, "Pour La Victoire",," for the benefit of a group of united charities. Manhattan Center was crowded and an overflow meeting was held in a nearby hall. Mr. Conrad Thibault sang the "Star Spangled Banner" and Madame Genevieve Tabouis opened the meeting.
I had the pleasure of introducing Mlle. Eve Curie, who spoke on her travels in the various battle-torn countries. It was an extraordinarily interesting hour-and-a-half. There were light touches here and there in her address, but on the whole the factual presentation of these travels made a deep impression on me.
They showed a power of observation and analysis of situations and people, which must have been based on a calmness and self-possession even in moments of danger. As a woman, I am always proud when women acquit themselves so well in any job which they are allowed to undertake.
I reached Washington again in the very early hours of the morning and I was reminded of the time when I was greeted with a "good morning",," instead of a "good night."
