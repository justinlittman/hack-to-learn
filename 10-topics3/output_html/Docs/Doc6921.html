                     WASHINGTON, Thursdayâ€”The Mayor of Cincinnati, Ohio;, Rabbi Wohl, with several other members of the Forum met us at the train at 8:00 o'clock yesterday morning. I am always a little overwhelmed by these early morning attentions, because I feel that the hosts put themselves out so tremendously and nothing you can do or say can really repay them.
They drove us to the hotel and left us to eat our breakfast, and at 9:30 the press appeared. I did a little work on the broadcast for civilian-defense, which I made at 1:15, and saw some of the staff of the volunteer bureau, which is already established here, though still without a local defense set-upsetup.

I had promised my daughter weeks ago, to do an article for the Christmas number of her paper. It was more difficult to write this year, because suggestions for Christmas giving have to be thought out with greater care than usual.
After the broadcast, Mrs. Thomas McAllister came to lunch. She is a member of the Voluntary Participation Committee forof the office of civilian-defense in her region.

He tells me that it is made by a little shop that refuses to be commercialized, remains the same size, keeps the same saleswomen, and will not acquire a large clientileclientele. I can testify that it is some of the best candy I have ever eaten.
We went to the lecture without dinner, and returned to some delicousdelicious creamed chicken and milk, which fortified us for our night of travel.
I visited two of our schools in the District of Columbia this morning, one for white children and one for colored children. They are putting on a program for civilian-defense. I have a plea from the military chairman of the waste paper conservation campaign, in which she tells me that everybody is being asked to conserve waste paper. Papers that lie about the house, or any package that comes in, should have its wrappings removed at once and put into a convenient place to turn over to the...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(19%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic10.html>mrs morning mr washington afternoon time night miss back dinner</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(17%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>people work men women country war labor service great business</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(14%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>children school city education work year community care york schools</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(12%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>house park beautiful hyde back morning drove place looked told</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(12%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>united nations world part reproduction prohibited general states committee rights</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(10%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>young home time good boys told find woman things thought</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(7%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic7.html>york mr american interesting women group interest young city dr</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
