                     WASHINGTON, Sunday—We left hyde-park early Friday morning, changed trains in new-york City and came straight through to Washington, to find ourselves slightly warmer on arrival than we had been in the early morning hours at hyde-park.

In many communities, Catholic, Protestant and Jewish Churcheschurches are working together, and sometimes the auxiliaries send home townhometown newspapers to the boys far from home.
