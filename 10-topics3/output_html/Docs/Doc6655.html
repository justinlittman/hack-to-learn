                  â€”Mrs. Lawrence Townsend's first musicale of the year, yesterday morning, was really a treat to us all. Madame Jarmila Novotna, a Czech artist, not only sang delightfully, but looked a charming picture in her floor-length, red dress.

He has many records of people in his own country, and I think he is right that such programs would bring about a greater familiarity with personalities in the unitedstates.
Mrs. Ernest Schelling is planning to bring to our attention in the near future, a nationwide movement which she is proposing, to pay a tribute to Mr. Paderewski during a week in February. He has given so much to the people of our country that I am sure this series of concerts, which is to be given throughout the nation in his honor, will bring forth a great outpouring of affection for Mr. Paderewski.
