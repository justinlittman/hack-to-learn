                  â€”So many tributes have been paid in the last few days to Chief Justice Harlan Stone that I have waited until now to add my little word of appreciation for a very great citizen. He was a liberal and stood out many times for the liberal point of view. I think the quality which a casual acquaintance, such as I was, sensed most keenly about him was his calm courage. You knew instinctively that if he believed in a thing, he would stand by it.

Part of the time it was actually snowing; but when we arrived, Fala greeted us with such warmth that I had to take him for a walk in the woods at once, regardless of the weather.

I had been meaning to find them and send them to their owners ever since I moved them to the cottage, but I have been neglectful. Triumphantly I discovered them all and I hope this week they will start to their destinations.
