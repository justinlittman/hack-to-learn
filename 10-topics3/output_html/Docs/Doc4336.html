                     PARIS.—Doctor Halsted, Anna, Nina and I spent one morning in   with Mr. Thomas Power Jr., who is the unitednations Resident Representative there, coordinating the work of the various U.N. agencies. Iran has next-to-the-largest program in the world dealing with technical assistance from the U.N., so it is a good place to evaluate the work of the specialized agencies.
The men sitting around the room were an impressive-looking group—fine faces, strong personalities, and for the most part they were men who knew many parts of the world, for they came from 17 different nations.
