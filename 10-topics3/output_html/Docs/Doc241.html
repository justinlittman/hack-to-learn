                     LONDON
                  —Since I have been here, I have been interested in comparing the wartime London I saw in 1942 and the peacetime London of 1946.
Almost everyone speaks to you of one great change—the blackout is over! However, though everybody extols the wonders of light, one has to confess that there really isn't a great deal of illumination in the streets of London at night. Of course, it is better than it was when no one could even light a match without being ordered to put it out, but it is not Broadway, newyork!
Many of the newspapers are still only four pages. It is quite evident that paper is still extremely scarce, and I marvel, just as I did before, at how much the news can be condensed.
Now to some of the other aspects of life in this great city. When I was here in 1942, London had gone through the Blitz and the great fire which had swept the heart of the city. Around Saint Paul's, there was empty space wherever you looked. Since then, more bombs, including the V-1 and V-2 bombs, have added to the destruction.
I got some figures which were given out by the Ministry of Works last June. London has about 2,200,000 dwellings, and it was estimated that, of that number, about three-fourths received some kind of damage. In the London civil-defense region, over 100,000 dwellings were destroyed or damaged beyond repair. In ten months, over 1,000,000 houses were damaged by rockets and flying bombs.
As rapidly as possible, repairs have been made, but these have been hampered by lack of materials and lack of manpower.
To really understand what the above figures mean, we have to translate them into human misery. Much of the damage was in the poorer parts of London. Though these sections have small houses, nevertheless they teem with human beings. It is true that many families have been moved to other places, but the percentage of people who have been moved is not as great as the percentage of homes destroyed, which means that people have doubled up in the available living quarters in a way which must ...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(27%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>house told good beautiful place small land water summer looked</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(20%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>children people school education city program work country money community</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(12%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>women work men young home war service boys day time</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(8%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>mr city interesting made american great told syndicate gave mrs</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(8%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>people things great time feel man make life find thing</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(7%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic7.html>government president people party democratic state situation made communist newyork</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(6%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>committee part labor united prohibited general organization state government public</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(5%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic6.html>world people country war countries peace part nations great nation</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
