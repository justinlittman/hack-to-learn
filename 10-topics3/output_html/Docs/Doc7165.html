                     WASHINGTON, Tuesday—Even at this season in Washington, one has a few visitorsfromvisitors from out of town. Yesterday afternoon, Senora de SamozaSenora de Somoza, wife of the President of Nicaragua, and her daughter, and Senora Donna Hena De BayleSenora Dona Hena de Bayle, wife of the Nicaraguan Minister, came to pay me a call. Senora De SamozaSenora de Somoza brought me two examples of work done by people in different parts of her country.
The needlework of the women, represented by lace and embroideryonembroidery on some handkerchiefs, is really exquisite. The gold filigree work, done by people living near the coast, is also a work of art. She told me she obtained this lovely gold filigree necklace when she attended ceremonies in connection with the road being built from the unitedstates through Mexico and Central America to South America.

The "big shot" in the film, himself recognizes he would not be so keen to employ a criminal if he were doing the employing. He redeems himself in the end by being unwilling to let an innocent boy suffer in his place.
To me, the most important point brought out, was the fact that in all this underworld racket, there is usually some "highly respectable" person who takes no risks but gets much profit out of those who take them. There are many people who are, perhaps, not quite as bad as the lawyer in the picture, but degrees of crookedness are usually measured only by opportunity.
