                     newyork, Sunday
                  â€”On Thursday I spent a short time in my office and was delighted to have a chance to talk with Richard Winslow, who is doing a very interesting study on various organizations in the field of foreign affairs.
Then at noon I went down to St. Paul's Chapel for a service to commemorate U.N. Week. St. Paul's, erected in 1766, is the oldest of the Trinity parish chapels. I have always loved the churchyard at the back of St. Paul's and the historic feeling of this little chapel, where Washington worshipped when newyork was the national capital. The altar piece was designed by Major L'Enfant, who was Washington's surveyor general and who laid out our national capital in Washington, D.C.
Besides the vicar, Rev. Robert C. Hunsicker, a number of other clergymen took part in the service. Afterward we went over to Whyte's for lunch. This is a famous downtown restaurant for seafood, and I only hope my hosts enjoyed their lunch as much as I did.
I was given a new book of poems by Phyllis McGinley the other day, and have very much enjoyed reading it. The book has humor and is written in the lighter vein, although some of the poems I found very moving. The author has a real gift and much skill in her writing.
I particularly relished one poem called "Meditations During A Permanent Wave." I join with her fervently when she says:
Those of us who are unblessed know only too well how true that is!
Miss McGinley's reflections on the poems and plays of T.S. Eliot also struck a responsive chord, as when she writes:
I subscribe to that heartily, for a great deal of what T.S. Eliot has written is a riddle to me. Nevertheless, his poetry has a fascination, and I find I have to read it!
