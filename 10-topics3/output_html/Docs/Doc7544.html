                     WASHINGTON, Friday—I went to my first Christmas sale for the benefit of French War Relief yesterday afternoon. The French residents in Washington certainly carried out the reputation which all French people have for using their needles and their fingers in making attractive gifts. I bought a number of things which I know will please someone at Christmas time.
Later in the afternoon, I received the members of the War HospitalityCommittee at tea. This Committee has done a very remarkable job. The District of Columbia is a mecca for nearby service menservicemen, who want to see their nation's capitol when they have a furlough. There are all kinds of military organizations here, outside of the military people who actuallywork in the departments.
The result is a constantly shifting population of service menservicemen and women who do not know the city and who may be looking for temporary or permanent places in which to live. They may be here for just a few hours and want to see as much as possible. Whatever they want, this committee tries to see that it is provided and, by and large, I think they succeed.
We have another difficulty here. Civilian war workers in offices have to be considered on nearly the same basis as the service people, since many of them come from other towns and are strangers here and need help and advice on arrival.
I notice in the papers today that some of the results of the ballot taken by the United Council of Church Women yesterday are beginning ing to come in. The questions asked were interesting.
