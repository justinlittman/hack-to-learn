                     LONDON, Wednesday,—I went to Covent Garden, the Royal Opera House, for a performance of "La Traviata".." They have a very pleasant custom—the opera begins at 7 o'clock, and then the audience eats a buffet supper between the acts. Sir John and Lady Anderson, representing the Government, which now runs the opera, and Mr. Anthony Gishford, representing the opera company, were my hosts.
As we went in, the theater looked so fresh and newly decorated that knowing all the difficulties there are in obtaining materials, I was interested to be told that the material on the walls had been found put away, so that they had been able to keep the old Victorian atmosphere in redecorating the house.

The difficulty was solved by having every member of the staff and every worker give up one coupon of his own.
When you realize that no one has more than 48 coupons a year, you know that that one coupon was a precious gift. And it shows how hungry the British people are for beauty and gaiety, even when they can enjoy it for only a few short hours by attending a performance of opera.
