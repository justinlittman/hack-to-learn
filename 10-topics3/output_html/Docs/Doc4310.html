                  —I spent last Wednesday night at Choate School in Wallingford, Conn., and had the pleasure of again meeting the headmaster, Mr. Seymour St. John, and his wife. The last time Mr. St. John and I met we were in Moscow. He was with a large group of educators studying Russian educational procedures and I was on my own trying to find out something about juvenile delinquency in the soviet-union.
Mr. St. John came back from his trip convinced that for our own safety our young people should know more of what was being done in the soviet-union. So, in line with his findings, he will institute at Choate a summer program of Russian studies, with the first one scheduled for this coming summer.
