                     WASHINGTON, Tuesday
                  â€”Last night the President returned in time for dinner from the ball game, which he had enjoyed in spite of the rain. The rain had wet the children playing on the whitehouse lawn, but we had ceased to worry because we could do nothing about it.

I always enjoy these informal parties, where a committee of ladies act as hostesses and bring delicious salads, cakes and coffee and wait on the guests.
I had not seen Mrs. Garner in some weeks and she looks very well and very young. Before luncheon was over, I discovered several very good reasons. In the first place, she eats judiciously and carefully and, in the second place, she was up and walking about this neighborhood, she told me, at 5:30 this morning.
