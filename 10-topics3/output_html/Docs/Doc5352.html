                     —Real November weather, a gray day and not very cold and the weather bureau promises that tomorrow will be the same. I was in the Village of hyde-park this morning and in the first shop a woman came up to me and said: "Real Democratic weather, Mrs. Roosevelt!" Everyone else smiled. It is a very Republican spot so I always smile rather tentatively at every one, but this morning they all smiled back and even the Republican leader asked me how the President was.
I imagine that secretly even though they may vote against him, they will not really object if he is reelected! If he is defeated they will feel kindly towards him as you always do when you win out against an adversary, whom you do not really dislike and who continues to be your good neighbor.
A rather interesting thing about the mail these days is the number of people whom we have never seen who write me stating that they are sure the President will be reelected and they hope he will do this or that in his next term. They show plainly that they want his reelection for very definite reasons, that they expect the next four years to bring some very definite achievements. I think this is a good omen for the people are really thinking and beginning to realize that their help is needed...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(25%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic6.html>people government president state york democratic party congress communist power</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(23%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>people life day world today years things great country read</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(17%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>house park beautiful hyde back morning drove place looked told</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(11%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic10.html>mrs morning mr washington afternoon time night miss back dinner</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(9%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>young home time good boys told find woman things thought</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(7%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>united nations world part reproduction prohibited general states committee rights</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
