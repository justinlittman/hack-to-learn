It suggests a movement "uniting American women for decisive action against the threat of worldwide nuclear slaughter."
But I am afraid this letter and one that is enclosed and which is being sent to the chairmen of the Democratic and Republican national committees indicate that this is just another movement where the heart has outstripped the head. The dear ladies are demanding "immediate disarmament, a ban on tests and an honest, responsible approach to cooperation with all nations, by refusing to vote for any candidate of either party for any office who does not publicly support this policy."
No honest candidate can agree to immediate disarmament. He knows that political questions, which create sore spots in the world, have to be settled before there can be complete disarmament.
There must also be a total membership in the unitednations before any total ban on armaments can be effected, since one nation cannot disarm unless every one does. Would it be possible, for instance, to leave Communist China, outside the U.S., armed?
Such objectives as these ladies have are laudable, but "immediate" is a word that shows a total lack of comprehension of the problems involved. Sponsoring the kind of movement such as this is, no matter how well-intentioned, discredits certain women with other thinking men and women.
I promised to tell you more about MtMr.. & Mrs. Irving Salomon's ranch in Escondido, Calif. It is called Rancho Lilac because there was once a little town there called Lilac, which is on the early California maps. There is the tiniest post office with 50 boxes, which sufficed when Lilac was a town.
Everyone in town was bought out some 36 years ago by a gentleman who decided that this was the one climate in the world that would cure him of his sinus and arthritis and, having enough of this world's goods, he simply bought almost the whole little valley. The place has changed hands only twice since then. The first owner moved nearby, being now 92 years old, and the next owner stayed only seven years. Mr. Salomon, the present owner, has now been there 15 years.
Mr. Salomon is raising pedigreed Herefords for breeding purposes, and at the present moment they are grazing in the hills, for California has had more rain than usual recently, and the cattle looked very attractive as we drove around a part of the ranch. He used to raise hogs but he has decided that that loses too much money. He has olive trees, but he can buy olives more cheaply than he can pick them. He takes keen pleasure in the fact that the milk and cream and butter and cottage chees...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(20%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>house told good beautiful place small land water summer looked</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(18%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic7.html>government president people party democratic state situation made communist newyork</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(12%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>mr city interesting made american great told syndicate gave mrs</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(11%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>morning mrs afternoon back time yesterday night miss washington lunch</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(9%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>children people school education city program work country money community</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(8%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic6.html>world people country war countries peace part nations great nation</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(7%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic10.html>newyork young year day good hope book called read copyright</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(6%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>committee part labor united prohibited general organization state government public</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(5%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>people things great time feel man make life find thing</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
