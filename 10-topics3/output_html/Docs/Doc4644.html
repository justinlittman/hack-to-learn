It suggests a movement "uniting American women for decisive action against the threat of worldwide nuclear slaughter."
But I am afraid this letter and one that is enclosed and which is being sent to the chairmen of the Democratic and Republican national committees indicate that this is just another movement where the heart has outstripped the head. The dear ladies are demanding "immediate disarmament, a ban on tests and an honest, responsible approach to cooperation with all nations, by refusing to vote for any candidate of either party for any office who does not publicly support this policy."
No honest candidate can agree to immediate disarmament. He knows that political questions, which create sore spots in the world, have to be settled before there can be complete disarmament.
There must also be a total membership in the united-nations before any total ban on armaments can be effected, since one nation cannot disarm unless every one does. Would it be possible, for instance, to leave Communist China, outside the U.S., armed?
Such objectives as these ladies have are laudable, but "immediate" is a word that shows a total lack of comprehension of the problems involved. Sponsoring the kind of movement such as this is, no matter how well-intentioned, discredits certain women with other thinking men and women.
I promised to tell you more about MtMr.. & Mrs. Irving Salomon's ranch in Escondido, Calif. It is called Rancho Lilac because there was once a little town there called Lilac, which is on the early California maps. There is the tiniest post office with 50 boxes, which sufficed when Lilac was a town.
Everyone in town was bought out some 36 years ago by a gentleman who decided that this was the one climate in the world that would cure him of his sinus and arthritis and, having enough of this world's goods, he simply bought almost the whole little valley. The place has changed hands only twice since then. The first owner moved nearby, being now 92 years old, and the next owner stayed only seven years. Mr. Salomon, the present owner, has now been there 15 years.
Mr. Salomon is raising pedigreed Herefords for breeding purposes, and at the present moment they are grazing in the hills, for California has had more rain than usual recently, and the cattle looked very attractive as we drove around a part of the ranch. He used to raise hogs but he has decided that that loses too much money. He has olive trees, but he can buy olives more cheaply than he can pick them. He takes keen pleasure in the fact that the milk and cream and butter and cottage chees...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(19%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>house park beautiful hyde back morning drove place looked told</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(15%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic6.html>people government president state york democratic party congress communist power</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(10%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>united nations world part reproduction prohibited general states committee rights</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(10%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic7.html>york mr american interesting women group interest young city dr</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(9%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>people work men women country war labor service great business</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(9%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic10.html>mrs morning mr washington afternoon time night miss back dinner</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(8%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>people life day world today years things great country read</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(8%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>world people united country countries war soviet great union states</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(7%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>young home time good boys told find woman things thought</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(6%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>children school city education work year community care york schools</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
