At luncheon we had a chance to discuss some of Miss Katharine Lenroot's concerns, and today she is off to join the others attending the conference in Mexico City.
This should prove a most interesting and important conference for all of us who are anxious to see the nations in this hemisphere walk hand in hand toward greater development and understanding.
