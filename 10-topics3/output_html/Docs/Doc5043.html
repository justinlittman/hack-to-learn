                     newyork.—Everyone must be glad to know that an agreement on Laos has been worked out, though, quite frankly, I have very little faith in any permanent stability with a three-man executive coalition in any country—when the premier and the deputies must agree on key matters.
Who is to decide what are the key matters? These men in Laos—a neutralist, a conservative and a Communist—have agreed on little in the past. Few individuals do. The ability of three people to agree at all times is rare indeed. In fact, if it were human nature to do so, it would be just as well to delegate to one man the full power, which would save time and money!
Mr. Khrushchev's enthusiasm for this three-headed settlement is quite understandable, for it is the kind of thing he has been working toward in the unitednations.
One can only hope that these men in Laos will want to keep the country peaceful and neutral, that they will devote themselves to the development of better standards of living for the people of the country, and that they will be extremely careful not to violate any borders themselves and devote themselves to preventing the violation of their borders or their territory for any military purposes whatsoever.
The decision by the U.S. Supreme Court ordering a judicial examination of newyork State's legislative apportionment system makes it possible now for the whole question of representation between rural and urban areas to be studied.
It may take a very long time to change from the present type of representation, which gives the rural areas the dominant power in the newyork State legislature. Our large urban populations now have much less representation than the people of our rural areas. And this may not be changed unless the people of the state become really convinced that this examination should go forward quickly and with full reports to the people themselves.
If there is real interest, the Governor could expedite the whole procedure. But it would be difficult to expect a Republican Governor to look at this question objectively, since Republican strength is largely in rural areas and it is through the present type of apportionment that the Republicans have so very often controlled the newyork State legislature.
However, if the people really begin to decide that they want representation on a fair basis, they can make their interest known. And I hope they will take a really active interest because, it seems to me, the democratic process cannot go forward unless in our state legislature we have a really equitable representation of the population of the state as a whole.
There is much discussion at present of what should be done to stimulate the economy of our country, and I wonder whether the first thing should not be to call on a national basis a meeting of the heads of government, labor and industry and ask them to face the facts of the present revolutionary period in which we live as it affects both our economic and political life.
We do not like to face changes, but sometimes they are forced upon us and it is better to face them and clearly understand them and explain them to the people as a whole.
The particular situation that we are in at present will find economists differing on the manner in which such a situation should be met. But, as I see it, this is healthy and should give a good bisisbasis for discussion. What must be faced up to is that all essential information must be provided by government, labor and industry, and all operational procedure will require the full cooperation of the three groups. In addition, the education of our people as a whole is essential to beg...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(29%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic7.html>government president people party democratic state situation made communist newyork</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(20%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>committee part labor united prohibited general organization state government public</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(16%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>children people school education city program work country money community</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(14%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>people things great time feel man make life find thing</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(10%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic6.html>world people country war countries peace part nations great nation</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(6%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>mr city interesting made american great told syndicate gave mrs</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
