                  â€”Election Day has come and gone and in new-york Sstate the citizens elected former Governor Herbert H. Lehman as united-states Senator. That speaks well, I think, for the real discrimination exercised by our citizens.
The Republicans put on an extremely active campaign in the upstate areas where they are usually overwhelmingly strong, but Governor Lehman, who has won the vote of the people of this state on a number of previous occasions, was elected.

Isaacs, who is a man of integrity and liberalism, was the only Republican to make the City Council. The communist Ben Davis was turned down by the people of Harlem. On the whole, the Democrats were endorsed.
I do not think this means, however, that the Democrats do not have to make good on a liberal administration. I think the pleas made for the Mayor were on the ground that he would be the strongest advocate we had for good, clean government.
