                  —The British election results were not a very great surprise, but the margin should give Sir Anthony Eden an opportunity to carry through his policies and to feel that he has the country's backing.

It is a very moving story, and the more one sees of the results of war the more one hopes that people will find ways of settling their difficulties without recourse to war.
Those of us here in newyork who enjoyed seeing the exhibition of Steichen photographs at the Museum of Modern Art received with much interest and pleasure news that there is now a book, which is selling on the newsstands and in bookstores, called "The Family of Man," and which has good reproductions of the exhibition photographs.
