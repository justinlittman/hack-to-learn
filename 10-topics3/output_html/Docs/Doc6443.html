                     WASHINGTON, Sundayâ€”More and more women are attending the National Institute of Government Conference. Mrs. Dorothy McAllister, vice-chairman of the Women's Division of the National Democratic Committee, expected to have a few hundred women but they came by thousands, just as the young people came to the Citizenship Institute in February. They made so much noise in the galleries in the House of Representatives, the members had a hard time hearing themselves talk!
Though some cynciscynics may think they came because of an invitation to the white-house or for entertainment, I would like to pay tribute to Miss Molly Dewson, Mrs. Dorothy McAllister, Mrs. May Evans and the staff of the Women's Division of the Democratic National Committee, who have painstakingly developed the educational program for the Democratic women which has finally really created an informed group eager for closer contact with their government's officials.
Many of the women have little money and came at great personal sacrifice, for they are interested in the program which is being developed and want to know how they can make it more effective. This meeting has been one of the most heartening things to men and women alike in the Democratic Party.
