                  â€”We are already being told that some prices on steel will be raised immediately and some a little later on. I cannot see that a settlement of the recent strike which raises the cost of steel is a very happy solution.
I received from the organization for constitutional government a letter which stated that it was necessary to keep down the constant demands of labor because they were responsible for the inflation.
It seems to me, however, that labor and management both have to bear a little responsibility, and I can understand labor's point of view. It is rarely that a union asks only for a rise in wages. Unions usually ask for improvement in conditions of work and for welfare measures of some kind that will safeguard the future and ensure the family's well being.
In the case of the steel companies, I think their published profits and the salaries of management at the top certainly give a justification for labor to feel that it should have a greater proportion of the wealth created, since the end product is produced by labor's daily contribution.
I do not think labor alone can be, or should be, held responsible for inflation. Of course, in this particular instance it seems to me that the settlement of the strike and the prompt announcement that steel prices will go up does not give us much cause for rejoicing. I think it points to a joint responsibility on the part of labor and on the part of management for increasing inflation.
There was a strange story in a new-york City newspaper last week to the effect that the Transit Authority had all along the $35,000,000 available to pay the amount needed for the two-year contract agreement with the Transport Workers' Union.
One wonders, then, what the fuss was all about and why wasn't this hidden amount, which adds up to the total needed to settle the recent threatened strike, discovered sooner. To wait till a few minutes before the new year was ushered in was dramatic, but it all seems a funny business to the layman.
How can a business have several millions "hidden" away? You can't usually do that in your private bookkeeping, so it seems a little odd in public bookkeeping.
A high-school youngster on a school paper came to interview me the other day and said he was discouraged to find so much graft in public life, and how did I explain it. I have no explanation except that if you can hide large sums of money in a public authority it is not astonishing that private individuals, who may have some desperate needs, should occasionally try to meet their personal needs out of the public purse. These individuals apparently see it being done by elected public of...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(38%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>people work men women country war labor service great business</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(18%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic6.html>people government president state york democratic party congress communist power</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(11%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>people life day world today years things great country read</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(9%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>world people united country countries war soviet great union states</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(8%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>children school city education work year community care york schools</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
