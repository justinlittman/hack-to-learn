                  â€”I have a favorite niece in Detroit, Mrs. Edward Elliott, whom I visited when I was in that city last week endweekend. Her husband is a young architect and an interior decorator who is trying to establish his own office.
Now that her four children have reached an age when even the youngest, who is a little girl, can be in nursery school, Mrs. Elliott herself has gone back into the Cranbrook Art School to explore the different media of expression and find out what she really feels is the thing she cares most to do. Her drawings and sculptures are always a joy to me, and when she tells me the story of the family doings in pictures they remind me of Boutet de Monvel.
