                     CHAPEL HILL, NORTH CAROLINACHAPEL HILL, N.C., Wednesday.—Our bad luck on train schedules followed us on last Friday night and our train from the West came in after 2 A.M.a.m. instead of at midnight.

I have been asked several times in press conferences how I feel about the passage by the Senate of the Equal Rights Amendment.
