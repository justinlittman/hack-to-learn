                     PARIS,Wednesday.â€”The French government is still trying hard to get acceptance from somebody to form a new Cabinet. President Vincent Auriol is waiting to hear from M. Edgar Faure, who is the latest person he has tried to interest. Of Ccourse, it doesn't surprise me that a man is hesitant to head the government here because it always seems to last such a short time and there is always a need to do something drastic, which cannot be done in a short time.

Also, on Tuesday afternoon the Polish delegate introduced a resolution that called upon the General Assembly to contact the proper authorities in Spain and to make representations on behalf of the 24 prisoners who have been in jail since the Barcelona strike.
