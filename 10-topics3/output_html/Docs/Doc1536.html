                  —There is a new publication called The united-nations Gram which made its bow last week. It is designed primarily to acquaint people with the facts about the united-nations. Every issue has two parts and is so made up that it can be placed on the bulletin board of schools or clubs or factories or wherever people going by can stop and look and read.

He maintains that we must not raise the cost of the organization to a point where we may force out the smaller nations because of their inability to pay their share. Of course, some of the bigger nations complain as much about the heavy cost as do the little nations, and there is the danger of making it an undue burden on governments that still are called upon to carry big budgets for armaments and for the cost of past a...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(27%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>united nations world part reproduction prohibited general states committee rights</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(14%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>children school city education work year community care york schools</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(13%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic6.html>people government president state york democratic party congress communist power</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(12%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>people work men women country war labor service great business</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(12%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>people life day world today years things great country read</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(9%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>world people united country countries war soviet great union states</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(7%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>young home time good boys told find woman things thought</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(6%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic7.html>york mr american interesting women group interest young city dr</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
