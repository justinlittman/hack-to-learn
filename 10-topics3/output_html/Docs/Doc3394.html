The decision of whether this work shall be in the whitehouse or not is one that he evidently is undertaking to wrestle with in the few days that he will spend at Secretary of the Treasury George M. Humphrey's estate in Georgia. Whether that means he is consulting Mr. Humphrey on this or whether it means he will make his decision without consulting anyone, no one knows.
