                  â€”I have in my mail some questions from an American citizen living in Fresno, Calif., and these are some of the things he asks:
"How can an individual, stigmatized as an inferior being, something less than a normal human, as a second-string citizen, and an American 'untouchable,' prevent himself from feeling these attitudes deeply and being scarred indelibly?
"Do you think the South has made progress in overcoming this problem?
"Do you believe the American Negro will ever reach the status of first-class citizenship?
"What can you and we do as individuals besides putting our own prejudices aside?"
These are very important questions.
There was a meeting at the Carnegie Endowment Building last Wednesday afternoon of organizations interested in how the American people feel about the Suez Canal issue and its submission to the unitednations, which since has been done.
Quite naturally, the American Association for the U.N. feels this question should have been submitted to the U.N. at the very beginning of the controversy and, conscious of the difficulties in finding a peaceful solution now, AAUN members feel that something yet will be achieved by the unitednations toward settlement of this problem.
