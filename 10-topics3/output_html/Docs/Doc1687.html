                  â€”Yesterday afternoon I went to the Library to greet a group of German teachers brought over here for a year's work in our universities. They have only been in America for a short time and that time has been spent in new-york City.
During the time I spent with them they asked many questions, some of which, I think, are of great interest to us all. In particular one teacher said "You seem less conscious here of the far reaching meaning of the Korean War than we are in Germany. To us it is of daily, vital interest, and I don't feel that interest among the people of the united-states to whom I have talked."
This does not seem to be an idea that has occurred solely to this German teacher because I noticed in one of our metropolitan newspapers an article referring to a similar impression. One reason for such an impression is that before the united-states is awakened and aware of a situation the conflagration has to be a very big conflagration, and thank goodness the war in Korea has not yet reached those proportions.
However, it is incumbent upon us, as Americans, to realize that the war in Korea is a symbol. It is a symbol of the relative strength of the Communist and democratic states. If the combined forces of the united-nations eventually show that they have the organization and power to localize and bring to an end this particular group of aggressors, in spite of the strong backing which they are receiving from Communist nations, then nations all over the world will feel strengthened.
