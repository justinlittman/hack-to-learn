                     WASHINGTON, Monday —This morning, I saw a heading in the newspaper which distrubed me very much. On reading the story, it appeared that one of our admirals was before a committee in Congress and reported that the Walsh—Healey bill was creating contractual difficulties and retarding the defense program.
He asserted that this act, under which firms accepting government contracts are required to meet certain labor standards fixed by their industries: "continues to be a disturbing factor in the procurement of some lines of government supplies." He emphasized the reluctance of many manufacturers to bid for government contracts because of the minimum wage determinations, and cited experiences with steel and aircraft clock manufacturers as examples to illustrate his point.
I think it is often forgotten that it is the red tape surrounding the government work which deters people as much as any legal restrictions. Payment is slow and many difficulties arise which do not arise in private contracts.

I cannot escape the feeling, however, that the tendency has been, so far, to say that labor much make sacrifices of wages and hours because of the necessities of national defense. I have yet to see anywhere a statement that manufacturers and business concerns and the general public through investment returns, shall make this same type of sacrifice in the cause of national defense, by cutting profits and reducing the salaries of their executives.

The workers can do nothing, I grant you, without the men at the top and what they represent in capital investment and in ability and experience. It is quite evident that this a co-operativecooperative job. Sacrifices will have to be equal.
