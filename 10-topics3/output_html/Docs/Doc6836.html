                     hydepark, Wednesdayâ€”I returned to hydepark yesterday in time for a swim and a nice, cool dinner on the porch. Then came long hours of work at my desk, catching up with the mail.
Yesterday, in newyork City, was given over in great part to seeing various people, after which I visited the hairdresser, a very feminine occupation.
I was glad to see that the House of Representatives, in considering the tax bill, did not accept the idea of joint income tax returns for husband and wife. I realize that this might bring in a higher revenue, for it would frequently put the tax returns in the group where surtaxes make the tax much higher.
However, it seems to me that some other way of obtaining money would be wiserthanwiser than a measure which strikes at the roots of a fundamental principle, which we in this country have been establishing over a long period of years; the right of women to be considered as persons.

I do not think that, fundamentally, the way to solve the problem is to say that people should grow lazy and not use what abilities and wits a kindly Providence may have given them. I realize that this is a question which can be argued from many points of view and this column is too short to cover it adequately. I am only trying to point out the fact that we have some decisions to make in the future, and we had better think them through intelligently and make sure of what we really believ...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(23%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>children people school education city program work country money community</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(17%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>people things great time feel man make life find thing</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(15%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>committee part labor united prohibited general organization state government public</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(12%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>morning mrs afternoon back time yesterday night miss washington lunch</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(11%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>women work men young home war service boys day time</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(11%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic6.html>world people country war countries peace part nations great nation</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
