                     hydepark.â€”Police Commissioner Stephen P. Kennedy of newyork City has started a cadet program in his department which I think has considerable interest for young people.
Under the present law no person can be appointed to the police force until he reaches the age of 21. The new program is designed to interest young people from the time they leave high school, for usually by the time most boys are 21 they are often already started on some kind of work and do not want to consider taking up law enforcement as a career.
Through attendance at the Police Academy and on-the-job training in nonenforcement police duties, cadets will be trained for careers on the police force. During this time cadets also will be encouraged to enroll in the police program of the Bernard M. Baruch School of City College.
