                     hyde-park.â€”Police Commissioner Stephen P. Kennedy of new-york City has started a cadet program in his department which I think has considerable interest for young people.
Under the present law no person can be appointed to the police force until he reaches the age of 21. The new program is designed to interest young people from the time they leave high school, for usually by the time most boys are 21 they are often already started on some kind of work and do not want to consider taking up law enforcement as a career.
Through attendance at the Police Academy and on-the-job training in nonenforcement police duties, cadets will be trained for careers on the police force. During this time cadets also will be encouraged to enroll in the police program of the Bernard M. Baruch School of City College. Cadets may, however, attend any other accredited college in the metropolitan area, provided the course of study is related substantially to some phase of police work such as psychology, law, sociology, and busines...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(25%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic7.html>york mr american interesting women group interest young city dr</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(23%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>children school city education work year community care york schools</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(19%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>people work men women country war labor service great business</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(9%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic6.html>people government president state york democratic party congress communist power</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(6%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>house park beautiful hyde back morning drove place looked told</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
