                     WASHINGTON, Fridayâ€”In the last two days, at tea and lunch, I have talked before the Women's National Press Club, the American Newspaper Women's Club, and the Women's Advisory Committee of the War Manpower Commission.
Yesterday morning, I spent at Silver Spring, Md., where the ambulatory patients go from Walter Reed Hospital. This was formerly a girls' school and it is quite surprising how well it has been rearranged to fit the needs of convalescent soldiers. It does not seem like a hospital, which I think is a great advantage when you are getting well.
This morning, I spent some time going through some of the wards at Walter Reed Hospital. One is impressed by the fact that automobiles and ordinary accidents at home are responsible for the presence of quite a few of the patients. Those who are back from overeas are, of coursocourse, suffering from more permanent disabilities. They are facing those handicaps with remarkable courage and cheerfulness.
I think one great advantage of being with other men similarly injured is the reassurance it gives that any man can learn to do as well. One boy this morning was longing to get back to his farm and he wondered whether a leg off above the knee was going to make his work impossible. I am quite sure that after a little while he will be able to do everything he did before, but the thing which will make him sure will be to see somebody walk in who has learned to get around with both legs off.
