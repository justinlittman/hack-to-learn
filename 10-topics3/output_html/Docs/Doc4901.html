                     ROCHESTER, N.Y.
                  â€”It is entirely understandable that Sen. Barry Goldwater of Arizona would like to see the welfare code of Newburgh, N.Y. adopted by every city in the country, for the principles embodied in the code seem to conform to his theories of government and his personal beliefs.
This interest seems to transcend any concern on his part as to whether a welfare code formulated by one city is either legal in the Statestate of newyork or humanitarian.
No one would object to those reforms that would really put to work people who should go to work and for whom work is available. I think, too, the people themselves would be the last to want to remain on welfare rolls if they could afford to get off.
But to jeopardize the health and welfare of little children before you assure the breadwinners that jobs are available for everyone who can work is to demonstrate a lack of human understanding and sympathy.
Some reports say the welfare code is aimed at a transient group in Newburgh composed largely of Negroes. I have no idea whether this is true, for I have not been able to make an investigation. But some of the articles I have read lead me to believe that I am not wrong in fearing that humanitarian principles are being completely ignored.
I have never heard that Senator Goldwater championed those underprivileged groups that need a champion in his own state. Yet there are people in Arizona who might very well occupy his interest, which is not really needed in newyork.
The Family Services Association of America has initiated a program which I think groups of people all over the country should know more about. It is called "Plays for Living," and KatherineKatharine Cornell is honorary chairman and Cornelia Otis Skinner is vice-chairman. You can see that two very fine professionals are in back of this idea.
Miss Cornell says of it:
"'Plays for Living' came into being to dramatize family and community problems with the techniques of the professional theatre. Its governing committee is made up of representatives from the helping professions, and from the theatre world, working jointly. A team from these two disciplines develops every play out of the grass-rootsgrassroots work of the organization commissioning the play. The dramatic result is not propaganda but a mirror of actuality to stimuatestimulate the audienc...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(28%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>children people school education city program work country money community</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(18%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic10.html>newyork young year day good hope book called read copyright</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(17%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic7.html>government president people party democratic state situation made communist newyork</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(11%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>committee part labor united prohibited general organization state government public</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(8%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>people things great time feel man make life find thing</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(7%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>mr city interesting made american great told syndicate gave mrs</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
