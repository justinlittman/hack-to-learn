                     Cincinnati, OhioCINCINNATI, Mondayâ€”We left Albany last evening. Not having had time all day to read the papers, we spent some going through what news one can assimilate from from the voluminous metropolitan press. We woke to the sunny Ohio countryside and the first Ohio paper I looked at while I waited for breakfast in the diner, carried Dorothy Thompson's column.
