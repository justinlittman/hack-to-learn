                     newyork, Thursday
                  â€”I read a story in The newyork Times this week about the wonderful work that 40 men from SeaBee Unit 317 did for the Boy Scouts in 17 hours of working time. This job was done in connection with the observance of Armed Forces Week and as part of the men's regular training.
These SeaBeesSeabees from the newyork area are veterans of World War II and the Korean War, and they put up 22 buildings and built a three-quarter-mile stretch of road in record time.
The man in charge was Lt. Comdr. George Hayden, who served with the SeaBees in the Aleutian Islands during World War II. He explained that the work the men were doing was much the same as that which they had done during the war.
This project was first planned by Commander Nyal Deems for assignment to the regularly drilling reserve units, but soon many SeaBees not associated with the Reserve offered their services, and one callcan well imagine what a pleasure they would get out of it.
These SeaBeesSeabees have special skills and they put them to use to achieve good purposes. Here was a whole Boy Scout camp which would ordinarily have cost for labor somewhere around $10,000. In two days the SeaBeesSeabees did the job, without pay, and it is estimated that ordinarily it would have taken six or eight weeks to complete the camp.

I am sure their admiration and compliments were unstinted, because it would have been a long time before this camp would have become a reality if it had not been for the Reserve SeaBeesSeabees. These men are carrying out similar work in many different places.
