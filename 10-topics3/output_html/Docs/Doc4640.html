                  â€”I have just received information from the East Side neighborhood group in new-york which is fighting the demolition of a block of historic brownstone houses located on Second Avenue between 19th and 20th Streets. Their problem is one with which middle-income apartment dwellers everywhere can readily sympathize.
In new-york's current building boom it is natural, I suppose, that Second Avenue should now be coveted by those who want to build luxury apartment houses which will rent at a higher rate than the old-fashioned "Florida Flats." But these tenants are putting up a fight because their apartments, while old-fashioned, still provide good housing for their families and should not, they feel, be destroyed.
Some of the old residents have been there 45 years. The apartments, ranging from four to eight rooms, were built at the turn of the century and were once elegant homes. Though no longer elegant, they are comfortable and rent from about $50 to $135 a month. This is a manageable price for those who need moderate-priced housing, whereas there will probably be nothing as comfortable and inexpensive in the new house which will go up.
People in this middle-income group do deserve some consideration. The Florida Flats' tenants council's attorney thinks they have some good legal points on which to base their case. There will be new zoning laws in force in 1961 and the new luxury apartment building would violate these future laws.

They live in new-york City to be near their work, and it is understandable that the Rent CommisionCommission hearing attended by 30 members of the tenant association, according to the N. Y. Times, was "noisy." If you were trying to preserve your home, I think you would be noisy too. Certainly I have great sympathy with the tenants and hope they will find enough legal points so that the...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(26%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>children school city education work year community care york schools</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(13%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>house park beautiful hyde back morning drove place looked told</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(12%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>united nations world part reproduction prohibited general states committee rights</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(11%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>world people united country countries war soviet great union states</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(11%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic7.html>york mr american interesting women group interest young city dr</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(8%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>people work men women country war labor service great business</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(8%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>people life day world today years things great country read</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(7%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic6.html>people government president state york democratic party congress communist power</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
