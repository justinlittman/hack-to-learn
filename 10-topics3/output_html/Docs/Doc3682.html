                  â€”I have just made a trip through the Middle West, at the time that the President was visiting the drought areas. I noticed one newspaper photograph which showed Secretary Benson in a farmer's field, leaning over and sifting some of the parched earth through his hands.
I am sure that the interest being shown in these areas will be deeply appreciated and probably give renewed courage to the farmers who must struggle through these difficult years. At best, they cannot remedy the damage in a short time; but they may get loans to tide them over, and they may even get rain which will help them in the immediate situation.
The long-term solution, however, is a Federal program which makes a study of the whole area and decides what needs to be done for the future. Otherwise these droughts will continue, the winds will come and blow away the topsoil, and when heavy rains do come there will be water erosion which will cause more damage. Some of this land should probably go back to the type of grass for grazing which once covered a large part of the area. In some places, shelter belts of trees should be planted.
