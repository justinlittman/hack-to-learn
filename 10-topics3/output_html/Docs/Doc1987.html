                     hyde-park, Thursday
                  —Tomorrow I will write about some more important questions. But just for today I feel like forgetting that uncertainty hangs over us throughout the world, and sharing with you some of the little things that make for security in spite of world-shaking events.
Yesterday I spent a few hours in new-york City. My niece, her two small boys and I left hyde-park by car at 7:30 in the morning. I had two people to see—one at 10 and one at 10:45—and a recording to do for the Crusade for Freedom.

She likes gentlemen very much and I am sure she will put herself out to win him the first 10 minutes of their acquaintance. I have always found that she rises to an occasion.
