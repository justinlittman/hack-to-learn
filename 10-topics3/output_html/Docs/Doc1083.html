                     PARIS, Friday
                  —It is interesting to note that whereas up to the last few days the united-states was considered to be the firmest in its stand on international affairs, since the speeches of British Foreign Secretary Ernest Bevin and Belgian Premier Paul-Henri Spaak there is a feeling that they have taken a much firmer stand even than the U.

There is more and more evidence in committee work here that there is a growing solidarity in the world on more than one subject. And there also is a general feeling that the minority position occupied by the Russians is due to misconceptions and fears rather than to real convictions.
In the Paris edition of the new-york Herald Tribune I read a quotation from a speech made by Henry Wallace a few days ago, which read: "There is an illusion of unity among the united-states, Great Britain and France which really does not exist. It is a unity of Governments, not of the people."
I do not know to whom Mr. Wallace talked when he travelled in Great Britain and France, but I personally think there is a greater division possible between the three Governments mentioned than there is among the people.

The French people know they helped the united-states in her Revolution many years ago, and it is easy to like people whom you have assisted.

And though we may be more severe on our families than we are where strangers are concerned, still when danger threatens the ranks are quickly closed. And when Mr. Wallace goes on to say that—concerning the latest accusations against Russia—in case this conflict is ignited, the British people will not be our loyal allies as in times p...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(29%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>world people united country countries war soviet great union states</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(29%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>united nations world part reproduction prohibited general states committee rights</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(12%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic6.html>people government president state york democratic party congress communist power</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(10%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>people life day world today years things great country read</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(7%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>young home time good boys told find woman things thought</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
