We looked wistfully at the grass and trees outside, for picnicking there is really half the fun of this particular group.
After it was over I went up to say a few words at the meeting of the Temple Sisterhood, and at 5:00 I went to Mrs. George Barnett's for tea. She gave the party in honor of Mrs. Frances Parkinson Keyes' new and recently published novel, "Parts Unknown." These parties are usually entertaining, for they draw a mixture of literary and social friends and I always enjoy seeing Mrs. Keyes.
In the evening I went to a parent-teachers meeting at the Central High School and then took the midnight train for new-york City.
A number of errands have filled my day and I had the pleasure of seeing friends at lunch and tea. Shortly, I must be ready to attend the American Booksellers Association dinner. They have kindly asked me to speak and, while I am deeply appreciative of the courtesy, I hope they will not discover how nervous I am about my talk!
