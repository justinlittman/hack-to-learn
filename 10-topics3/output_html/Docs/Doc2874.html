                  —Poor Senator McCarthy! He must be feeling much in need of support.
One of his ardent backers has just sent me a clipping of a newspaper article written by William SF. Buckley, Jr., co-author of the book, "McCarthy and His Enemies." In one paragraph of this article, it is interesting to find the famous Dreyfus case dragged in and McCarthy likened to Dreyfus.

McCarthy is a pretty lucky person, even if his followers do feel the need of defending him so violently.
Those who have a serene sense of their own clear conscience usually do not feel it is important either to be defended or to defend themselves very violently, and I can only judge that there is a certain uncertainty about the Senator—or his friends would not be so vociferous in his behalf.
