                     new-york Citynew-york, Wednesdayâ€”This is the most delightful July weather that I can remember, warm enough in the sun to enjoy drying off after a swim, but cool enough so that even a good walk is not too exhausting. I tried walking in the woods yesterday afternoon, but found the mosquitoes were still in undisputed possession!
My little birds got out of their nest this morning and paraded along the ledge, exercising their wings by flapping them up and down, but they hopped back into the nest with great rapidity when their mother appeared with a worm.
