                     WASHINGTON, Mondayâ€”It was perfectly wonderful on Saturday morning, when I stepped off the train, to be met at 7:00 o'clock by our eldest son, who had just flown in from the Coast on orders. I find that in war time these visits are always a surprise. They are doubly unremarkable

My nephew, Mr. Henry Roosevelt, also was with us for a brief two days, so we had a quiet family dinner Saturday night. Yesterday, I went to see a friend in the hospital and devoted most of the afternoon catching up on mail.

We have a perfectly lovely baby spending a few days with us in the white-house. She is three -andthree-and-a-half months old, the daughter of my cousins, Mr. and Mrs. W. Forbes Morgan Jr., and seemed completely engrossed in the President so long as he held her in his arms.
The Governor of New Hampshire, the Honorable Robert O. Blood, has sent me two wonderful wooden pails. The They are called "Granite State Bom-Pails," and he says: "We of New Hampshire are pleased to contribute in a small way to the national defense program by furnishing a substitute which will conserve scarce material, such as metal, using our hurricane lumber and using labor of an average of sixty years of age as is found in our pail factories.
