                  —I have been having the pleasure recently of meeting a number of the women whom I met while I was in Japan.
One charming young woman attended the Summer Institute at Harvard. Now, she is taking a year's leave from her work in Japan and is going to Bryn Mawr College to study human relationships, particularly those between men and women.
You may smile at this idea but, if you lived in Japan, it would not be a matter for amusement. The pattern of Japanese life is changing, and women who were merely immured in their husband's homes, ran the household, bore the children and took care of them until they were old enough to be taken over by the men, are now realising that they may be factors—in different ways—for good in the life of the country.

Madame Sumiko Tanaka is young and full of charm. She wears her native costume most of the time, but she would look appropriately dressed in Western costume too. She is intelligent, with a remarkable command of the English language, and I feel sure she will not only benefit by her time here, but will do much for the relationship between Japan and the unitedstates if she is able to meet a great many people while she is here.

The book and the music are agreeable, and Shirley Booth is excellent, but it is one of those plays in which Americans make fun of themselves in the past, and the picture of Coney Island is not exactly accurate. Miss Tanaka enjoyed herself and was amused. However, when I heard her murmur: "Now I know what Coney Island is like," I thought I had better tell h...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(22%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>people things great time feel man make life find thing</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(15%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>women work men young home war service boys day time</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(14%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic10.html>newyork young year day good hope book called read copyright</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(13%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>house told good beautiful place small land water summer looked</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(10%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>mr city interesting made american great told syndicate gave mrs</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(8%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic6.html>world people country war countries peace part nations great nation</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(7%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>morning mrs afternoon back time yesterday night miss washington lunch</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
