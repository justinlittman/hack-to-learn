He can be reached through P.O. Box 2737, Grand Central Station, and he invites anyone who has an idea as to how to preserve the peace of the world to send it to him.
He has a plan of his own, which I think is rather impractical but, nevertheless, I am passing it along because it shows how very anxious certain people are to preserve the peace in our country. Here is a somewhat cut-down version of it:
