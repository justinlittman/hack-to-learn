                  PHILADELPHIA, Monday
                     â€”For a long while people have been trying to make me understand what a self-help cooperative could do. A gentleman came all the way from California to explain what was being done in the west. But it was not until I visited the Washington work exchange yesterday that I finally understood its possibilities.
It will vary of course, to fit each locality but the principle of these cooperatives is basically much the same, as the principle of a subsidy for low cost houses.

For example, the barber in the exchange works there for an hour a day and takes out of the shop clothes that his children need to wear to school which he has not been able to earn cash for at his regular job. In addition to this many young people come in, shabby and disheartened. They go to work in the sewing room, in the laundry, in the kitchen perhaps.
