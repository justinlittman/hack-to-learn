                     WASHINGTON.â€”A broad and worthwhile program for the celebration of unitednations Week was outlined by York Langton in a report to the board of directors of the American Association for the unitednations which has just concluded its annual conference here.
While the unitedstates Committee for the unitednations has the chief responsibility for the celebration of unitednations Day on October 24, the A.A.U.N.AAUN always has emphasized setting aside the entire week for education of our people in the aims and achievements of this international organization.
Speakers cannot always be obtained for a community on unitednations Day itself. So if we spread our opportunity for mass meetings throughout the week, we are apt to meet the needs of more communities.
And if we organize our cooperation with as many non-governmental organizations as possible for the whole week, there can be a greater variety of worthwhile programs across the country which will appeal to the greatest number of people.
The studious ones can attend unitednations workshops. Young people especially are interested in unitednations tree plantings which, if carried on from year to year by a sufficient number of organizations, can mean a substantial beautification of some areas.
Hospitality can be organized for international students, with festivals by nationality groups that can be made very colorful and entertaining. I am sure that many persons appreciated the radio and television programs in past years, particularly those in which children, whose birthdays fall on the same date as the unitednations', take part and enjoy a unitednations birthday cake.
I happen to be interested in foreign foods. And so, last year when I went around to celebrations of unitednations Week, I was delighted to find nationality groups in several places putting on unitednations suppers which ran all the way from a smorgasbord to the finest in French foods.
I wish that every community planning a unitednations Week program this year would make a point of having an information center, exhibiting all the free methods of obtaining and spreading information about the unitednations. There are flag sets, globes, an international cook bookcookbook and the book that Mr. Spicker wrote, and which I helped edit, on the unitednations. Then there are Clark Eichelberger's book, "U.N.; the First Ten Years," and pamphlets and leaflets galore.
For a really successful celebration of unitednations Week, an organization should get together not later than this month to coordinate plans and to allot each group the work it will be responsible for.
I am glad that Mr. Langton's outstanding report on unitednations Week proved so interesting to all members of our board of directors and I hope it will mean the appointment in every group of a unitednations Week chairman who can be at work all the year around.
As a result of the lengthy meeting of the A.A.U.N.AAUN board of governors, there will be a great number of recommedationsrecommendations to the board of directors at its next meeting. Two things of importance were possible to consider by the directors at this meeting, however. As a result, in the future we will have a nominating committee made up of both boards, and the names of those chosen by the board of governors to serve were accepted. I hope other recommendations will be acted ...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(26%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic10.html>newyork young year day good hope book called read copyright</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(22%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>committee part labor united prohibited general organization state government public</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(21%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>children people school education city program work country money community</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(13%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic6.html>world people country war countries peace part nations great nation</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(7%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>mr city interesting made american great told syndicate gave mrs</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
