                     hydeparkhydepark, Fridayâ€”I am still revelling in the beauty which we enjoyed yesterday. I think this year the coloring is particularly vivid. Nothing could have been lovelier than the whole drive over the Mohawk Trail and then down through Pittsfield, Lenox and Stockbridge, Mass., to reach home about 6:00 o'clock.
We found two friends waiting to greet us and had a very pleasant evening, though Miss Thompson attacked the mountain of mail which is always the result of a few days' holiday. She brought me enough work at 10:30 to keep me busy until 3:00 a.m.
I did not get started so early this morning.

They know the value of planning a program and carrying it out systematically. They know how to obtain publicity and what kind of publicity will help to spread interest in democracy. The business women in this country could really organize many of the unorganized women and carry out a program of working in and for a democracy.
They would first have to make sure that every woman knew what democracy meant to her and saw in terms of the way she lives her daily life. That takes into account how she treats her friends and the people who work for her in her home or in other capacities where her life touches theirs and, above all, what she does to cooperate with her government to preserve democracy, not for herself alone, but for all the people in the country.
