                  —I had a letter the other day from a man in one of the displaced persons camps in our zone in Germany. He is a Latvian and he wrote a little story for what I take to be the camp paper.
It begins in this way: "The other day we were discussing emigration. I told my wife that so many countries think they have enough of their own people, and they do not want to have too many.

I wonder what it is that makes some people able to argue a whole evening on such subjects as socialized medicine, inheritance taxes, and what one's obligations are to the future under certain situations, instead of worrying about more tangible things like a new car or a new fur coat.
