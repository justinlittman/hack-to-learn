                  —I spoke in Milwaukee for Bonds for Israel and on Thursday morning I flew to Chicago. From there I took a plane to Atlanta, Ga., to speak again for this same cause, and at 6 o'clock Friday morning got into Washington for a meeting with the Negro Council of Women. Then I returned to newyork.
It seems important to me that all of us should look at the situation now confronting the world.
The sovietunion has established itself in Egypt and is seeking a growing influence there and in the other Arab states. The only state not under Soviet influence in the Near East is Israel.
Because of threats from the sovietunion and the disapproval of the unitedstates and other countries in the unitednations, it has not been clearly understood that Israel acted in self-defense. She could not sit like a duck in the middle of the pond and wait for the hunters. She had to try to defend herself before the arming of surrounding states was complete.
As much as we may deplore that Great Britain and France acted in a manner considered aggressive, just as Israel did, we should remember they since have signified their willingness to submit to the U.N. This leaves Egypt's dictator, Gamal Abdel Nasser, still in power and certainly has not lessened the growing Soviet power in the Near East.
The Soviets also have demonstrated in Hungary how they will treat any satellite that tries to gain greater freedom even though remaining Communist. This, we hope, has affected world opinion somewhat.
