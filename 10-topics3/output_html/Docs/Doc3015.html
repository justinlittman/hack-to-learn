Anyone who read Senator Flanders' statement to the Russian people and had any sense of the importance of international unity must have seen the value of this message, which appealed to all the Soviet-controlled people for disarmament and for peaceful cooperation.
Whether Senator Jenner likes it or not, all men in this world are brothers. We hope that eventually they will be friends, and to tell them truthfully that we must learn to live together in peace, because there is no alternative except destruction of the whole human race, is a very wise thing to do.

Thus, the fashion picture is recorded at least for every fourth year.
