                     newyork.â€”The start of the debate on colonialism in the unitednations was insisted upon by the sovietunion, which hoped to achieve condemnation of many of the Western powers through condemnation of the colonial idea as a whole. One of the interesting sidelights is that the Soviets are fearful of military bases being established, or which have already been established, by free nations in some of the "colonial" areas.
Of course, it is well recognized now that the colonial situation is outdated. It certainly is disappearing as rapidly as possible, and it seems that the value of military bases also is disappearing. So, the Soviets' agitation may be outmoded, too, where this particular threat is concerned. And it may be of value to the Western nations to be able to give up these bases, which are rather expensive and a drain on the countries that have to maintain them.
Russia's resolution is aimed entirely at controlling Western colonialism, but the African and Asia states have introduced a resolution that is far more general in its application. Both resolutions invoke the charter principles, but instead of immediate end of colonialism, as demanded by the Soviets, the Afro-Asian resolution requests a "speedy end" to colonialism. Both resolutions ask for "self-determination," but the Soviets carefully ask it only for people outside their own orbit.
The one weakness of the Afro-Asian resolution lies in these words: "inadequacy of political, economic, social or cultural preparedness" shall not serve as a pretext for denying independence.

Most people have taken it to mean that self-determination by the people required certain abilities or qualities in the people before it could be exercised. But more and more the habit has grown to make self-determination a basic right without any qualifications attached to it.
