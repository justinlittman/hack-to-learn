                  â€”Winter is really paying us all a visit, and I must say that I rather enjoy it. I imagine, though, the Mayor is delighted that the snow turned to rain before the downfall became too heavy. It would have been impossible to use any water to clean the streets!

I suppose if you are going down to posterity in a portrait, the most pleasant way is being painted by a delightful and very finished artist who makes you look as nice as possible.

In the late afternoon Miss Thompson, Miss Hickok and I drove out to Scarsdale for a meeting of the Scarsdale Democratic Club at which I spoke on "The united-nations Today." It was not good driving weather and I felt a little guilty at being driven both ways. But it certainly was a very pleasant and easy way to keep this engagement. We had a very delightful buffet dinner before the meeting at the home of Mr. and Mrs. Arthur S. Meyer.
