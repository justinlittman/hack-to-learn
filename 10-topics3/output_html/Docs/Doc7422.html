                     hydeparkhydepark, Wednesdayâ€”The two little girls who are staying with me manage to put in the most exciting days and find and create all their own excitement.

I have known too many women in the older age brackets who are good workers, and too full of energy to look with complacency on anything which will prevent them from being able to earn a living.
