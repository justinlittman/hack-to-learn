                     hydepark, N. Y.hydepark, Sundayâ€”My interest in the school lunch problem took up so much space that I haven't told you what I have been doing in the past few days.
I went to newyork City on Thursday and had an interesting talkintalk in the afternoon with a committee of home economics teachers working in the public schools of newyork City. They have a summer workshop in which they are discussing school curricula.
