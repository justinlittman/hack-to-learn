                     new-york.—I am particularly glad that the united-nations voted to take up simultaneously the Indian proposition for a revival of the moratorium on nuclear tests without any reference to control and the U.S.-British draft treaty calling for the prohibition of tests under effective international control.
India and the soviet-union wanted their resolution discussed first and were opposed to simultaneous discussion, but an overwhelming vote overruled their desires.
