                  â€”Last night we held the last of the big dinners of the year. Senator Frederick Hale, of Maine, took me into dinner and remarked: "Don't you get terribly tired of all this?"
As a matter of fact, everybody gets tired of any one occupation, whether it is work or entertainment. Whoever wrote the ancient saying, "Variety is the spice of life, "" knew the nature of human beings quite well. Merely going to work at the same hour every day, even if the nature of the task you perform is varied, is eventually tiresome. Anything repeated over and over again brings people to the point where they are stale and need a change of environment to vary their thoughts.
I have often wondered how it was possible for actors and actresses to throw themselves completely into their parts night after night. I imagine their salvation is an ability to live the part as though it were a new thing each night.
There was a well-known lecturer, I am told, who covered this country from coast to coast and gave the same lecture over and over again in exactly the same words with the same voice intonations and gestures. Apparently, he was always able to draw crowds and hold them, so he couldn't have been bored himself. But to me that is entirely inexplicable. I can talk on the same subject if I am getting a new slant on it from other people, or am able to draw something new out of my own head about it....</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(27%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>house park beautiful hyde back morning drove place looked told</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(19%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>young home time good boys told find woman things thought</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(16%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>people life day world today years things great country read</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(15%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic10.html>mrs morning mr washington afternoon time night miss back dinner</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(6%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic7.html>york mr american interesting women group interest young city dr</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(6%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>people work men women country war labor service great business</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
