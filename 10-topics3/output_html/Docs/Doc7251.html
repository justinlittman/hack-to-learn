                     newyork Citynewyork, Fridayâ€”Yesterday morning I attended a little ceremony. The Brooklyn Goodwill Welfare League, a group of women who have really done a remarkable piece of work in raising money and helping various war and local charities since the beginning of the war, named an ambulance they bought in memory of my mother-in-law. They would have liked to present it to the President, but it was not possible for him to give up the time, so he asked me to receive it.
The ambulance meets all the standard Army and Navy requirements and will serve shortly in some place where it can be of use to our armed forces.
This group seemed to me particularly active and energetic. I enjoyed very much being with them, and also seeing Mr. Newbold Morris again. He and I were the only speakers present.
From there I went to the College of the City of newyork and spoke in the Great Hall to a gathering of students. At City College;, they have the largest ROTC of any college in the country. It certainly was an impressive sight looking down on all those boys in uniform. They are so young and their responsibilitiesare responsibilities are so heavy.
The chairman of the meeting said to me afterwards that he felt it was not fair to say that the futurelay future  lay in the hands of youth alone, that all of us together will have to carry the burden. I agree with him, of course, and I think we older people have the obligation to look at the future realistically, but it is much harder for us not to be tied to the past. Perhaps, our best function is to evaluate the past and to try to point out what things seem to us to have proved themselve...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(22%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>women work men young home war service boys day time</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(16%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>children people school education city program work country money community</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(13%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>mr city interesting made american great told syndicate gave mrs</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(11%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>people things great time feel man make life find thing</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(10%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic6.html>world people country war countries peace part nations great nation</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(7%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic10.html>newyork young year day good hope book called read copyright</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(6%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>house told good beautiful place small land water summer looked</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(6%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>morning mrs afternoon back time yesterday night miss washington lunch</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(6%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic7.html>government president people party democratic state situation made communist newyork</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
