                     hyde-park, Sunday
                  â€”On Friday I saw the workings of a TV control room during the Tex and Jinx show. I must say it is a very busy place, and certainly gives one an understanding of how complicated it is to put on a TV performance.
We went afterwards into the studio where the show was being produced. With us was my old friend, John Golden, and somewhat to his surprise he found himself being photographed on TV, something which he assured me he had no intention of being done! He prefers the radio, where you are heard but not seen. However, these little impromptu shots in a long program are what make Tex and Jinx's show entertaining and unexpected.
I am constantly surprised to have Mr. Golden tell me that some friend of his is opposed to the U.N., on the ground that it has no value and accomplishes nothing. His answer, I believe, is about as good an answer as anyone can give to people who are thinking along what seems to me illogical lines. Mr. Golden replies: "If you can think of anything better, propose it. But in the meantime, isn't it essential to try to use the U.N. as far as we can, since it is the only thing we have to use?"
It also seems to me that people who make this objection are usually unaware of anything which goes on in the U.N. beyond the meetings in new-york City. They rarely know much about the work of the specialized agencies, of the technical assistance plan, or of the Children's Fund. I am sure if they made a study of the day-by-day activities of these agencies, they would at least acknowledge the value of this work in creating an atmosphere of greater understanding among the peoples of the world...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(17%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>united nations world part reproduction prohibited general states committee rights</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(15%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic7.html>york mr american interesting women group interest young city dr</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(13%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic10.html>mrs morning mr washington afternoon time night miss back dinner</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(12%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>people life day world today years things great country read</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(12%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>young home time good boys told find woman things thought</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(10%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>world people united country countries war soviet great union states</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(9%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic6.html>people government president state york democratic party congress communist power</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(5%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>children school city education work year community care york schools</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(5%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>people work men women country war labor service great business</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
