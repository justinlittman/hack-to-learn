                     hyde-parkhyde-park, Friday—I met my two eldest grandchildren this morning as they came off the train from Chicago, accompanied by Mrs. McDuffy. They looked fresh and blooming in spite of their long trip east from Seattle, which began on Tuesday night.

We spent very little time at the station, for the children were anxious to get home. Mrs. McDuffy went up to the house—with the bags in my mother-in-law's chauffeur-driven station wagon and the two children drove up with me. They exclaimed at every house and familiar landmark.

Edgar Hoover and his G-Men are doing, I am beginning to wonder whether another branch of the public service is not neglecting some very useful work.
Should not our local health departments keep a very careful watch over their communities and, at the first sign that any individual is mentally below par, should not steps be taken to safeguard the rest of the community? We have a big enough population now in our insane asylums, but there are other ways of improving the mental health of the nation and I think we have neglected this aspect of our health problem.
