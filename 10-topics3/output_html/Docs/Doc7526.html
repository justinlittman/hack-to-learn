                     hyde-parkhyde-park, Friday â€”Yesterday morning, I left my new-york Cityapartment fairly early and wontwent upto the colored orphan asylum in Riverdale, with some members of the board and interested friends.

At the present time, work for our children is particularly important because of the rise in juvenile delinquency.
