                     new-york, Thursday
                  â€”The world as a whole looks brighter today because of the foreign news. It is encouraging to be going off to the meeting in London, feeling that the three Foreign Ministers who have been meeting in Moscow, have found satisfactory settlements of controversial issues and have parted with warm and friendly words.
I have always found that personal relationships, however small and unimportant they may seem, have a bearing on the success of the settlement of bigger questions.
I am also very happy that President Truman is said to be going to talk to the nation right after the New Year. I think the people always appreciate the President's speaking directly to them on the issues that face the nation. If the people understand what the President wants to have done, they will make every effort to come up to any height which may make his leadership easier and stronger.
In our own domestic situation I feel we are still somewhat at sea, because various groups among us do not understand the full implications at home and abroad of any steps that we take in this country. I hope the President can make clear to us that everything we do at the present time is bound to bring hope or despair to the peoples of the world.
Yesterday afternoon I opened the door and found the weather suddenly like spring. Driving down this morning the snow seemed to have melted away and brown fields lay bare before our eyes where snow covered the landscape last Monday.
Before I left home, I took Fala out, but walking on the ice was precarious. Fala would slip and I would slip. He would bounce off into the snow, breaking the crust, and then have to take a tremendous jump to get out again.
Both of us felt that we would like to stay in the country with the blue sky overhead and the wonderful clean, exhilarating air. Fala rolled himself in the snow, and I am sure the crust scratched his back and then he would poke his nose down trying to tell what little animals had scurried around before him. There isn't any question about it, the country is the place for man and beast to live permanently. But back we had to trek for there isn't much time remaining before I leave on Sunday...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(32%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>house park beautiful hyde back morning drove place looked told</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(11%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>young home time good boys told find woman things thought</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(11%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic6.html>people government president state york democratic party congress communist power</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(11%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>world people united country countries war soviet great union states</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(11%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>people life day world today years things great country read</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(9%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic10.html>mrs morning mr washington afternoon time night miss back dinner</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(7%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>united nations world part reproduction prohibited general states committee rights</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(6%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>people work men women country war labor service great business</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
