                     newyork, Thursday
                  â€”At the plenary session of the General Assembly of the unitednations Wednesday afternoon we had been told that only Brazil and the unitedstates would be heard. But immediately following Secretary of State Dean Acheson's speech, to our surprise it was announced that Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Vishinsky would make his speech.
Secretary of State Acheson had stated, not in violent language but very honestly, what he feels has been the real obstacle to peace in our time. And there is certainly no chance to misunderstand what his feeling is about Soviet policies. What he said represented the thinking of the overwhelming majority of the citizens of the unitedstates.
In getting up to speak, Mr. Vishinsky was remarkably restrained. He said that later we would deal with the rude remarks made against the sovietunion by our Secretary of State, but in his speech he made no violent or vituperative attacks.
He cited the fact of the large increase in the military budget of the unitedstates and the additional expenditure in aid to rearm other countries. He failed entirely to give us a breakdown of the Russian budget for its war expenditures and for the help furnished satellite countries.
He stated again that atomic weapons should be outlawed and labeled the first nations to use atomic weapons as war criminals. Then he proceeded to advocate the international control of atomic energy and some kind of assurance through international means that no nation was making atomic weapons.
Again he failed to indicate that what has held up agreements on atomic energy control has been the refusal of the sovietunion to accept the kind of inspection other countries have deemed necessary for protection. Finally, he called for every great nation to reduce its armaments in every branch by one-third. Of course, he failed to say that this would leave the sovietunion in a position of complete mastery since it now has a far greater army than any other nation or combination of nations...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(46%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic7.html>government president people party democratic state situation made communist newyork</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(16%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic6.html>world people country war countries peace part nations great nation</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(14%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>committee part labor united prohibited general organization state government public</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(8%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>people things great time feel man make life find thing</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(5%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>women work men young home war service boys day time</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
