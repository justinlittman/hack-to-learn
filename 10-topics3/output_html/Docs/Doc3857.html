                  —I spent very little time in newyork this week, since I went to the city late Sunday evening and Monday morning, bright and early, took the 11 a.m. plane from Idlewild for Miami, Fla.
There I was met by a radio commentator and a photographer, but escaped them quickly and talked with ex-Senator Harry Cain about the television show which we were to do in the evening about the unitednations and the work of the American Association for the unitednations.
My friends, Mr. and Mrs. Joseph Gordon, were at the airport to meet me, and as soon as possible we set off to visit an old friend who lives not far away. Then, back to the Gordon'ss' delightful house where I had a rest and time to dress before we went out for dinner.

Nevertheless, the big hotels are all open and doing a good business, and so one can no longer call Southern Florida only a winter resort—it is actually a year-round resort. And while I felt it rather humid and too relaxing, my friends tell me that they have quite as much energy there as anywhere else.
Back in newyork I had the pleasure of seeing a Protestant bishop from Manila who has built a church and named it in memory of my husband. During the war he organized the chaplain services for the Philippine Islands and was one of those who lived through the "Death March" from Corregidor and was interned with General Jonathan Wainwright.
