                     hyde-park, Tuesday
                  â€”On Sunday morning we had the pleasure of having the Emperor Haile Selassie of Ethiopia visit us here at hyde-park. He laid a wreath on my husband's grave, then paid a short visit to the home and the Memorial Library. He was much interested in my husband's variety of interests, looked at the model ships and went through the stacks where papers and books are kept.
He reached my cottage just at 1 o'clock, when the recording of his appearanee on the television program, "Youth Wants to Know," was shown. The young people had asked him many questions and he had answered them willingly and cordially. Naturally, he wanted to see and hear the recording as it was going out over the country, so for half an hour we watched television.
Since his schedule required him to be in new-york City by 4:30, he had to leave here between 2:15 and 2:30. You can imagine that a buffet lunch served to 40 persons in three-quarters of an hour is rather hurried! But I think several people had a chance to talk to the Emperor while he ate; and I had a few minutes of conversation with him quietly before he left.
More and more I am impressed with how mercilessly we hurry our visitors! They must be so tired, I wonder if they can even enjoy the scenery as they drive.
I found the Emperor a most delightful person. His son is very unassuming and charming, and so is his granddaughter. In fact, I have rarely had a more enjoyable official party here. Though they were hurried, they behaved as though everything was just the way they wished it to be, and I hope they will carry away pleasant memories of their short time with us.
While I am here in Dutchess County, I would like to tell you about the work being done by the Dutchess County Association for Mentally Handicapped Children. Anyone who has a retarded child knows how difficult it is to find opportunities for the development of such children to the maximum of their abilities.
The society here is not very old, but since their campaign for funds last September, they have raised over $13,000. They have a school for mentally handicapped children. They painted their building red and named it the Little Red Schoolhouse. Some of the children have I.Q.'s below 50, others from 50 to 75. As you know, there is no provision in the public schools for children whose I.Q.'s are below 50. There are special classes occasionally for them but they seem to get on faster in a sc...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(28%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>children school city education work year community care york schools</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(20%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic10.html>mrs morning mr washington afternoon time night miss back dinner</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(17%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>young home time good boys told find woman things thought</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(9%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic7.html>york mr american interesting women group interest young city dr</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(7%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>house park beautiful hyde back morning drove place looked told</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(7%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>people life day world today years things great country read</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
