                  â€”A week ago in our church we were admonished that most of us, in our anxiety to make Christmas a festival of St. Nicholas, forgot that it was also the festival of the Christ Child. We were so weary buying presents and distributing them that we missed the real significance and peace and inspiration of the first Christmas when the great gift of a perfect life was made to mankind.
I think perhaps customs in certain other countries are more sensible than ours. Some countries celebrate on Christmas Day a religious fesitvalfestival only. It is not until St. Nicholas' Day that  comes a good week or more later that the children receive their presents and there is an exchange of presents even among the grownups.
This, however, is the custom in more leisurely countries than the unitedstates. I can almost hear the storm of protest if, after Christmas and the New Year holidays, we added a St. Nicholas festival which required another day off from what many of us consider the important business of life. So we will have to resign ourselves to our combination of religious and secular festivities, and try to organize our lives so that the Christmas Day itself and even Christmas Eve remain calm and peaceful...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(30%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic10.html>newyork young year day good hope book called read copyright</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(18%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>women work men young home war service boys day time</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(17%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic6.html>world people country war countries peace part nations great nation</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(8%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>house told good beautiful place small land water summer looked</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(7%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>people things great time feel man make life find thing</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(6%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>morning mrs afternoon back time yesterday night miss washington lunch</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(6%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>mr city interesting made american great told syndicate gave mrs</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
