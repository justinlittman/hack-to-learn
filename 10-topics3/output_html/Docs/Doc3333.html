                  —On last Monday morning I left home early enough to catch a 7:40 A.M.a.m. plane to New Orleans, but my plane was an hour and 20 minutes late in starting. Of course, I was late in arriving in New Orleans.
I found my hostess, Mrs. Frances Parkinson Keyes, waiting to take me to a much-delayed luncheon. Her main interest was not so much the luncheon but in having me see the beautiful house in the French Quarter which she has been gradually rescuing from decay.
Lately she has bought two lots, which were once the side garden of this lovely house in which Beauregard lived and which bears his name today. It is one of the few houses that has both a patio with the slave quarters at the back and a side garden. It really will be enchanting when all the repairs have been accomplished.
There is spaciousness in these old houses, and the woodwork is beautifully carved. You can sense that living was very gracious here in the days when people had more leisure time to spend in their own homes.
In the evening I attended the dinner for which I had come to speak. On Tuesday morning I took a plane at 8:00 o'clock for Chicago. This time I was on time and enjoyed a restful afternoon, with a friend coming to tea with me before going at 6:00 P.M.p.m. with Judge and Mrs. Fisher for a delightful dinner.
I spoke at a forum on the unitednations and its first 10 years and had ample time to change and pack and read for a couple of hours before catching what has become my habitual plane out of Chicago—the 2:45 A.M.a.m.
I was back in newyork at 6:30 A.M.a.m., but on my way to Philadelphia by 9:30 to speak at a lunch for Brandeis University.
These trips have given me an opportunity to read some of the manuscripts that have been sent me in the past few weeks. One was a story about myself written for teen-ageteenage girls. I confess that I find these biographies a little difficult, because it is really almost impossible to be objective and truthful about a person who is still alive. But I suppose there is some value in telling the facts as you know them, even though to me some of these facts do not seem to convey the real in...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(32%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>morning mrs afternoon back time yesterday night miss washington lunch</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(11%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>house told good beautiful place small land water summer looked</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(11%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>mr city interesting made american great told syndicate gave mrs</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(9%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic10.html>newyork young year day good hope book called read copyright</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(9%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic6.html>world people country war countries peace part nations great nation</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(9%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>committee part labor united prohibited general organization state government public</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(8%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>people things great time feel man make life find thing</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(5%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic7.html>government president people party democratic state situation made communist newyork</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
