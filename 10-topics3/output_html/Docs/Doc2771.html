                  â€”Washington's Birthday this year falls on Monday, which is fortunate for a great many people since it gives them a long week endweekend. I hope, however, that this particular day will never be looked upon just as a pleasant holiday. It should remind us first of all of a very great man who became head of the armies of the Republic and against great odds won for the 13 colonies their freedom and then presided over the government in the most difficult period of its infancy.
Of course, we were fortunate in that we were so far away from the country of our enemy and that transportation and communication were difficult in those days. This gave us time and a certain amount of security, but we had a good deal of insecurity in our own surroundings. We did not know at first how we were going to set up our government and which was the best way to function. Fortunately for us, George Washington was a patient man and he had the gift of surrounding himself with able men.
