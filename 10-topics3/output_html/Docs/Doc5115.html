                     Eurdora Ramsey Richardson, sent me by Mrs. Geline Bowman, Honorary President of the National Professional and Business Womens Clubs. This book which will, I hope before long be published so that women in general can obtain it, brought to my mind certain things we need to think about at present.
We have been passing laws and taking action in order to meet an emergency and as usually happens in such cases, very few of us have sat down and figured out whether we want to keep on indefinitely with these emergency measures, or whether we want to work toward more final results.
Take the concrete problem of unemployment, which as a by-product has produced discrimination against women, a tendency which we have seen in other nations grow to its natural climax in restricting women in all the fields which they have labored for years to enter. In Germany, I understand, highly trained scientific women are told their minds are of no use to their country, only their ability to bear children and to run a house economically and efficiently is of any real value.
We feel like saying "It can't happen here",," but unless we face the fact that this is a by-product of the great question now before us, we may wake up to find that we have gone the way of other nations who were unable to solve this situation.
Has every human who desires it the right to work?
Should not the best brains of our country work on this problem?
There are three fundamentals for human happinessâ€”work which will produce at least a minimum of material security; love and faith. These things must be made possible for all human beings, men and women alike.
