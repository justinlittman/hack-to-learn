                     hydepark, Wednesday
                  â€”Last night I spoke at the opening meeting of the hydepark Elementary School P.T.A.PTA. The program chairman, Mrs. George A. Palmer, wife of the Park Service Superintendent of the Memorial and Historical sites here, had asked me to take part of my address to the high school students and elaborate on it.
In my previous speech I had touched on preparation for meeting the new situation that we face in our country with regard to our relationship with the rest of the world.
I told the high school students that today we were not learning just to earn a living and continue thinking of our own interests alone. I said we were preparing ourselves to live in a world that was drawn much closer together by better communications and easier means of travel. This required of us expanded knowledge and interest in our fellow man. Therefore, we had to educate ourselves to understand the interests of people all over the world and how to tie them in with our own interests.
