                     newyork.â€”I have a letter from a woman on one of the problems of Social Security which I think I should share with my readers. A solution to the problem will require the thinking of those who make the laws on these subjects. And its presentation here may move people who have ideas as to how it might be solved to communicate with their representatives in Congress. The letter says:
"I have something I just have to get `off my chest,' and I would like to hear, or read, some opinions by you on this subject. My great anxiety concerns Social Security.

Practically all women are past working by age of 50. Their physical make-up just won't stand up (at least very few will) under the rigorous conditions imposed upon them by present-day competition.
