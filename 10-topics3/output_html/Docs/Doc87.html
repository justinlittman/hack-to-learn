                  â€”Over the radio this morning I heard the sad tales of the losses from floods in the western part of our state. I know that many of our farmers here in the Hudson valley have had crops ruined by the rain. and in addition are having great difficulty in getting labor enough to bring in the crops which they have. Right here on our own place we have men and women working on jobs which they never did before and that, I imagine, is duplicated on many farms throughout the country.
Yet the rain has been wonderful for the woods. As I walk every morning with Fala, I realize that it is a long time since I have seen our little planted pines make such a growth, or found such luxuriance of foliage everywhere. It is a grand year for mosquitoes, too. Sometimes I think I'll never walk past some of our swamps again till autumn, but then the beauty of the ferns draws me back.
Fala, too, has such a wonderful time hunting whatever may be the hidden things in that particular part of the woods, that I can't bear not to take him there. Occasion he gets a scent and disappears entirely I can't stand and wait for him, because the mosquitoes then settle on me with too much ease.
