                  â€”One of the really interesting announcements of the last few days was that made by Senator Robert A. Taft concerning next year's political conventions and the Presidential election. And, like all condidates, he exuded utmost confidence when he stated: "I will be nominated and elected."
How anyone knows so far ahead what a convention will do or what the citizens of the country will decide is difficult for me to understand. But I suppose Senator Taft's backers have counted noses and think they have a sufficient number of votes in the convention to defeat all comers, including General Dwight D.

It is interesting to have a statement from Senator Taft that he will restore "liberty, integrity and sound judgment" to the councils of the nation. It seems to me there are a good many men who are now included among those who counsel, who think they have liberty and integrity. Sound judgment is always a matter of opinion on decisions taken after the results of the judgment are available.
Senator Taft is going to carry on an active campaign and not make the mistake made by Governor Thomas E. Dewey when he ran for the Presidency. The Senator's platform seems to be condensed in the three following Points:
1. Opposition to what he called "socialism and excessive spending of the New Deal on the domestic front." This has a familiar ring, but it doesn't mean much until you really sit down and put into words what you are going to do away with. Would it be old-age pensions, social security, unemployment insurance, an effort to improve housing, care for the handicapped or the blind? Just what are you going to consider as socialistic and stop spending on it?
2. Criticism of the Truman Administration's "fatal mistakes" in foreign policy, including the War in Korea, the "building up of Russia," and "other disastrous occurrences due to their judgment." We will hope that the Korean War will be at an end before Senator Taft is called upon to correct these "fatal mistakes." If not, he will have something difficult to handle. I would like to have explained to me just how he feels Russia has been built up and what are the disastrous occurrences he r...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(36%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic7.html>government president people party democratic state situation made communist newyork</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(14%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>children people school education city program work country money community</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(12%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>people things great time feel man make life find thing</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(11%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>committee part labor united prohibited general organization state government public</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(7%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic6.html>world people country war countries peace part nations great nation</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(7%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic10.html>newyork young year day good hope book called read copyright</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
