                     new-york.â€”We are celebrating this month the 100th anniversary of Theodore Roosevelt's birth. No one in public life ever had any meaning to me before I became old enough to be conscious of this uncle of mine as a public character.
I grew up in my grandmother's house where politics was almost never mentioned and it was only when I began to read the newspapers myself that I became conscious of the first cartoons of Theodore Roosevelt as new-york City police commissioner with very prominent front teeth!
