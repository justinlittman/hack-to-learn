                     REEDSVILLE, W. Va., Tuesday
                  â€”I went to a homesteaders dance last night. Remembering that I liked the Virginia Reel they had one, and I went home half an hour later than I intended.
Nevertheless, we started out this morning at 8 a. m. from Mrs. Word's house. There were three cars in the party and five or six people among us who had never before been to Scotts Run.
I always find something new on these trips and this time we found a women we will call Mrs. Smith. I had gone in to ask her about quilt patterns but I found much more. We were in the kitchen, dining room of the typical miner's house, grimy no matter how much it is scrubbed but in the corner by the window was a dishpan with four nareissus bulbs, two of them in bloom. When I spoke of them Mrs. Smith said:
"Yes, when I brought them home my boy asked me why I brought these onions."
One of the party took a photograph of her little girl and promised to send her a copy of it. She said:
"Send it to Mrs. Mary Smith. If you cent it to Mrs. Jim Smith nobody would know who was meant."
Which revealed what was quite evident, that she was the personality in the family. I was not surprised to learn that she was making the fight to keep her daughter in West Virginia University. A very interesting person.
We reached Arthurdale about 10 and have been showing Dean and Mrs. Russell, and Dr. Dewey everything that is going on in the school.
It has been raining all day, not very hard but gently, as April rain should fall. For a little while I thought we were going to have a snowstorm, but that seems to have ceased. I am afraid this in adding to the already overfilled streams and rivers.
We have lunched with Miss Clapp and after some talk we will get the 4 o'clock train back to Washington.
