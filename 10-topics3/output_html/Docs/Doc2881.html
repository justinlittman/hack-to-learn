                  â€”The joint statement issued by our President and British Prime Minister Sir Winston Churchill was a very careful statement. But I think it is an encouraging one to all of us who hope for more concentration on how peaceful settlements are to be achieved and less concern about any retaliatory use of the H-bomb.
I am quite sure that, if we set our minds to devising ways to achieve the ends we desire through peaceful means, we will outwit the Soviets at their own game. At the moment, however, I sometimes think they do better than we by making it appear that they are more concerned with peace than we are.
I see that Sen. Pat McCarran of Nevada is afraid we will be too much under the influence of the British. I certainly do not want our leaders to be too much under any outside influence but, in the present case, I am anxious to see us work with the British to achieve peaceful solutions in Asia and in Europe.
I liked the news picture of Bernard Baruch and Sir Winston talking to each other. I am sure that everyone in this country wishes a good return trip to England for this elder statesman who, in spite of his age, crosses the Atlantic by air when he thinks the need is great.
On reading with care what transpired in the unitednations Security Council in regard to the fighting in Guatemala, I am inclined to think that the position taken by the unitedstates was not very carefully thought through.

And when it does just that, it is of vast importance to all the nations to have this forum and the collective world opinion that it represents.
Sometimes I think national representatives, like individuals, are inclined to take the position that seems to give the easiest solution to a situation at the moment, without thinking of the precedent which their decision might create and which might do great harm in the long run.
They tell me that the unitednations headquarters this week is overrun with teachers, who are here for the annual convention of the National Education Association. I can think of nothing better than to have the teachers of the country fully familiar with U.N. activities and really enthusiastic over its achievements. I think much of the indifference toward the U.N. that we sometimes find in our country is due to the fact that people in general do not actually know that the U.N. is a forc...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(29%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic6.html>world people country war countries peace part nations great nation</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(18%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic7.html>government president people party democratic state situation made communist newyork</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(18%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>committee part labor united prohibited general organization state government public</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(10%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>mr city interesting made american great told syndicate gave mrs</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(10%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>people things great time feel man make life find thing</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
