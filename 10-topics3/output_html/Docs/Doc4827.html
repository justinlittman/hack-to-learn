On my way back to newyork train men asked me if I wasn't traveling in the wrong direction, and when I told them that I was not going to Washington until Thursday they seemed relieved that I would be there on Friday.
On the way down to Baltimore, where I had gone to speak at a meeting commemorating Henrietta Szold's 100th birthday, I found myself at lunch with three people from Colorado who were on their way to the inauguration, and everyone I saw or spoke to was thinking of little else but this changeover of administration, what it means to them, and what it might mean to the world as a whole.
This is a solemn day, and a day when we might all join in prayer for the good health and the blessings of God Almighty on the man whom we, the people, have elected to try to solve our own and the world's problems.
On this past Wednesday Vassar College was 100 years old.
On January 18, 19611861, the newyork State legislature granted a charter to the college founded by Matthew Vassar, a prosperous brewer of Poughkeepsie, N.Y. This was the first adequately endowed women's college in the unitedstates that offered an education equal to that available to men. So, this centennial marks a century of higher education for women in this country.
There are other colleges where women were admitted or which were founded for women that received their charters earlier, but they were not adequately endowed. So, it remained for Matthew Vassar to be the first really to promote the idea of equality of education for women.
I have always enjoyed the way Mr. Vassar expressed it to the first Board of Trustees of Vassar College. He said: "It occurred to me that woman, having received from her Creator the same intellectual constitution as man, has the same right as man to intellectual culture and development."
His gift of $408,000 was so overwhelming for those days that the world of education was astounded. It gave confidence to those who needed reassurance as to women's ability, for here was a man backing up with cash his opinion that women could fulfill the rigorous requirements of a liberal arts degree.
Because of the Civil War, Vassar did not open its doors until 1865, but since that time 22,400 women have proved themselves able to graduate.
To mark this centennial year there will be a series of programs with these objectives: (1) to evaluate what 100 years of progress means in looking at Vassar today, (2) to set the goals and objectives to be attained in the next 100 years, (3) to have as many people as possible learn what an institution dedicated to the higher education of women such as Vassar College really can mean in the life of America, and (4) to reaffirm the highest principles set forth by Matthew Vassar when he fou...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(24%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic10.html>newyork young year day good hope book called read copyright</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(14%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>people things great time feel man make life find thing</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(13%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic6.html>world people country war countries peace part nations great nation</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(12%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>women work men young home war service boys day time</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(10%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>children people school education city program work country money community</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(7%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>committee part labor united prohibited general organization state government public</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(7%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic7.html>government president people party democratic state situation made communist newyork</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(7%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>morning mrs afternoon back time yesterday night miss washington lunch</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
