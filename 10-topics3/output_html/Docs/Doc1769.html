                     newyork, Mondayâ€”The news continues to be none too happy from Korea. None of us can help worrying, but perhaps this period of anxiety may be the best preparation we can have to harden us for the years that lie before us. We must strengthen ourselves in order to strengthen the unitednations. We are the frontier in any war that may come. And being the frontier, we can expect nobody else to carry the first responsibility.
On my television program Sunday afternoon I had some young people asking questions that had been on their minds, and when it was over one young girl came up to me and said: "This program has frightened me, Mrs. Roosevelt.

Our nation is the frontier today, and the decision and weight of responsibility is on our nation.
It isn't a pleasant place to be. Nevertheless, as we accept this responsibility, we must keep on doing the things that bring and hold us together and may, in the future, develop an understanding that will obviate some, if not all, of our present-day difficulties.

It is the story about guests these American youngsters invited from countries throughout the world to visit with them last summer in camp and on a trip that took in not only Tennessee and the Great Smoky Mountains but a number of other states between the two flights across the ocean. The project was undertaken to spur the development of friendship among our young people and th...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(18%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic6.html>world people country war countries peace part nations great nation</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(16%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>women work men young home war service boys day time</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(15%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>people things great time feel man make life find thing</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(12%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic10.html>newyork young year day good hope book called read copyright</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(11%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>morning mrs afternoon back time yesterday night miss washington lunch</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(9%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>house told good beautiful place small land water summer looked</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(7%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>mr city interesting made american great told syndicate gave mrs</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
