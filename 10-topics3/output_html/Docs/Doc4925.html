                     new-york.â€”I liked President Kennedy's answer given on Wednesday to the two neutralist leaders from the Belgrade meetings and I was particularly interested in his statement that the presence of our Secretary of State Dean Rusk and of Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko at the united-nations General Assembly next week would "provide an opportunity for serious talks about Germany and other problems if the Soviet side proves willing."
The General Assembly convenes next Tuesday, and it is evident that the President has decided to be quite sure that before there are any summit talks that other avenues shall have proved the possibility of making a summit talk serve a useful purpose.

When one has outgrown such threats, these threats may create contempt or may create amusement, but never panic.
