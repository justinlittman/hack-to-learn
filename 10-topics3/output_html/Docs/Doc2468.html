                     new-york, Monday
                  â€”I am writing this column from new-york after a rather lightning-fast week-endweekend trip to Detroit. I arrived in that busy metropolis by train from new-york City early on Saturday morning. The steps of the train were covered with snow, and I discovered that we had been through a heavy storm in northern new-york State. During the day the snow caught up with us in Detroit.
Detroit is a fantastic town! When you are there you readily begin to understand why anyone would say that "What is good for General Motors is good for the U.S." It is quite evident that everything revolves around the automobile.

My first visitor was a journalist from the Caribbean area. She was a little lady who spoke very little English, some French and a voluble Spanish. She explained that she had missed seeing me in new-york and so had made sure that she would see me in Detroit. I answered some of her questions but asked her to wait for the regular press conference at 10:30. Then we had pictures and the press came in.
I was amused to see a headline Sunday morning in the Hearst paper, which said that I said we should scrap the Yalta agreements. Of course, what I really said was that if the Soviets had not lived up to them, there was no reason why we should not scrap them. They already had been scrapped by the Soviets.
At 11 o'clock I was called for to go to the meeting of Detroit Public Schools members. I had a pleasant lunch with them and, following the luncheon, talked about the united-nations.
This was only the beginning of the day, however. Soon after this luncheon meeting some lady Democrats called for me and took me to a gathering of more than 2,000 Democratic women. Also present was Governor G. Mennen Williams, who is, I believe, the first Democratic governor to be elected three times in succession. He is a forceful and attractive personality, and has a young, pretty and delightful wife. Both of them seemed to know everybody in sight, and I heard someone remark to her that...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(26%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic10.html>mrs morning mr washington afternoon time night miss back dinner</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(16%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic7.html>york mr american interesting women group interest young city dr</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(12%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>united nations world part reproduction prohibited general states committee rights</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(10%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>house park beautiful hyde back morning drove place looked told</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(10%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic6.html>people government president state york democratic party congress communist power</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(7%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>people work men women country war labor service great business</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(7%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>young home time good boys told find woman things thought</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(5%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>world people united country countries war soviet great union states</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
