                     newyork, Monday
                  â€”I am writing this column from newyork after a rather lightning-fast week-endweekend trip to Detroit. I arrived in that busy metropolis by train from newyork City early on Saturday morning. The steps of the train were covered with snow, and I discovered that we had been through a heavy storm in northern newyork State. During the day the snow caught up with us in Detroit.
Detroit is a fantastic town! When you are there you readily begin to understand why anyone would say that "What is good for General Motors is good for the U.S." It is quite evident that everything revolves around the automobile.

My first visitor was a journalist from the Caribbean area. She was a little lady who spoke very little English, some French and a voluble Spanish. She explained that she had missed seeing me in newyork and so had made sure that she would see me in Detroit. I answered some of her questions but asked her to wait for the regular press conference at 10:30. Then we had pictures and the press came in.
I was amused to see a headline Sunday morning in the Hearst paper, which said that I said we should scrap the Yalta agreements. Of course, what I really said was that if the Soviets had not lived up to them, there was no reason why we should not scrap them. They already had been scrapped by the Soviets.
At 11 o'clock I was called for to go to the meeting of Detroit Public Schools members. I had a pleasant lunch with them and, following the luncheon, talked about the unitednations.
This was only the beginning of the day, however. Soon after this luncheon meeting some lady Democrats called for me and took me to a gathering of more than 2,000 Democratic women. Also present was Governor G. Mennen Williams, who is, I believe, the first Democratic governor to be elected three times in succession. He is a forceful and attractive personality, and has a young, pretty and delightful wife. Both of them seemed to know everybody in sight, and I heard someone remark to her that...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(30%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>morning mrs afternoon back time yesterday night miss washington lunch</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(14%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>mr city interesting made american great told syndicate gave mrs</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(11%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>house told good beautiful place small land water summer looked</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(10%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic7.html>government president people party democratic state situation made communist newyork</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(10%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>committee part labor united prohibited general organization state government public</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(8%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>people things great time feel man make life find thing</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(6%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic10.html>newyork young year day good hope book called read copyright</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(5%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>women work men young home war service boys day time</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
