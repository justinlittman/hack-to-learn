                     WASHINGTON, Monday
                  â€”Because I felt quite sure today would be a busy day, I went for a ride after lunch yesterday. On my return I found our son, John, had arrived with Mrs. Haven Clark and two of her daughters, Anne and Joan. Since Joan is about my grandaughter Sistie's age, I decided she would enjoy going to the Fort MeyerFort Myer pageant last night, given for the benefit of the Post Recreation and Relief Fund.

Two different groups met here during the afternoon. First a group of colored women under Mrs. Bethune had an opportunity to discuss their problems with the executives in the various departments in Washington who deal with the care of women and children, and particularly with colored groups. After them, the state administrators of Social Security met. I gathered a great deal of information from both meetings.
