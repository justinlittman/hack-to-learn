                  —The Chicago Tribune article which I have been analyzing point by point—relating to the humanrights Commission's efforts to write two covenants—did say that Senator Bricker did not accuse the unitedstates delegation of voting for the provision on euthenasiaeuthanasia, but it does not mention the fact that no petition can come up for a vote.
Senator Bricker maintained that this proposal is "consistent with the humanrights Covenant's basic legal philosophy. If the right to life is treated as a right granted by the state, it is not illogical to authorize the so-called right to death."
He and the Rev. Russell J. Clinchy, who is at present not acting as a minister but has taken a position on the staff of the Foundation for Economic Education, seem to have completely missed the point.
Fundamental humanrights, according to our view, are inalienable because all human beings have something in them of the Divine and, therefore, the Divine Power gives them certain inalienable humanrights. But a legal treaty must deal with the rights of states and the rights of the individual as regards the state and other individuals. This treaty is to safeguard those rights in human society.
No one knows exactly, as yet, what the wording in the eventual treaties will be. They have not yet been finally drafted by the commission. And even after they have been drafted they must pass through the hands of the Economic and Social Council and eventually through Committee 3 of the General Assembly before being voted on by the entire General Assembly. So, there are a good many steps to be gone through before you and I can look on these documents as being definitely and finally worded.
The Soviet Constitution, which Senator Bricker suggests was influential in this document, has no more to do with it than our own Constitution and Bill of Rights. In fact, it has often been stated that our Constitution and Bill of Rights were more nearly followed in certain instances than any other document.
It is true that the Soviet Constitution is based on different conceptions from ours, but so is the Islamic law, or the Hindu religion, and yet perhaps more people live according to these laws and religions than live with the belief in the Christian religion.
In drawing up the humanrights Covenant we should attempt to state the rights of individuals in such terms as to be acceptable to all peoples and all religions. We are not trying to subject other people to our particular manner of approaching a subject; we are trying to find common ground which, in the words that we know so well, will actually bring to the people of the world an opportunity for life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
Senator Bricker's statement that the State Department knows "the Russian principle must be substituted for the American principle if the Department is to get the humanrights proposals approved by ''communist, socialist, fascist and feudal majority' in the U.N." is utterly false. It has been accepted from the beginning that we would try primarily as a delegation to have accepted what we felt our own Senate could accept but to make every effort at the same time to meet the views of othe...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(53%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>committee part labor united prohibited general organization state government public</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(22%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic7.html>government president people party democratic state situation made communist newyork</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(9%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic6.html>world people country war countries peace part nations great nation</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(6%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>people things great time feel man make life find thing</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(6%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic10.html>newyork young year day good hope book called read copyright</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
