                  â€”I forgot to tell you yesterday that we were extremely frivolous on Wednesday night and went to see where Miami's Four Hundred disport themselves in the evening at the Royal Palm Club.

It reminded me of some of the sights I had seen along the Atlantic Coast after the tidal wave of last year.
I have just been told about the Sacks Foundation, which was started with the idea of encouraging young inteior decorators and which is now contemplating including branches of musical training and fashion design in their annual competition. The competition for interior decoration is open to students in accepted institutions in Greater newyork.
The design for the room receiving the first awardisaward is executed in every detail and open to the public. The current one is now ready at 505 Eighth Avenue, newyork City. I think as many people as possible who are interested in developing new vocations for young people, should go to see what these young decorators have done.
