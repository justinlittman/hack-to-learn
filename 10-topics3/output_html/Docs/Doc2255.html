                  —Today we mark another FourthFourth of July and I hope throughtthroughout the country all of us will re-read the Declaration of Independence.
This document, written by our forefathers, breathes a spirit of devotion to liberty.  This document was written by men who were adventurers.  For a variety of reasons they had left their own countries and come to live in a new world.
Just crossing the ocean in those days was a terrifying undertaking, and one that only hardy souls would undertake.  Would the small ships they traveled in survive the storm?  Would the food they took last for the journey?  Would disease and death visit them aboard their crowded ship?  What would they find in the new world?  How would they survive to the next harvest?  Would the people in the new land be friends or foes?
Everything was a gamble, a gamble for very high stakes—namely, life or death.
To these men who came to this country, being revolutionists was nothing new.  Since they had won in the difficult gamble of establishing themselves in this new world, it probably did not seem to them so impossible to overthrow a sovereign across the sea!
They succeeded in establishing the unitedstates of today, and we are the inheritors not only of these first adventurers but of the many waves of immigrants who followed year after year.  New people constantly left their countries for freedom's sake or feeling that here there was a livelihood to be achieved that could not be gained in the homes they were leaving behind.
We must not be allowed to forget that our forefathers had little security.  Each generation took care of itself.  That is probably one of the things we should always remember on the Fourth of July.
We seek to build a world in which our children may be more secure with material needs and from fears of aggression from without.  But perhaps we should not want to spare our children, since it is the things that we have to struggle for that are most important to us.  And each generation should have some measure of struggle.
We have acquired in this country a fair amount of physical ease over the years, but we must not let that blind us to the fact that we have a struggle still before us which is as much a spiritual as a material struggle.  Our forefathers came herhere for freedom's sake and we must not barter away that freedom.  It is as important to us today as it was to them.  The right to think and express our thoughts, the right to listen to whatever we choose, the right to meet and talk with whomeve...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(38%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic6.html>world people country war countries peace part nations great nation</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(18%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>people things great time feel man make life find thing</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(11%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>children people school education city program work country money community</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(9%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic10.html>newyork young year day good hope book called read copyright</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(8%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>women work men young home war service boys day time</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
