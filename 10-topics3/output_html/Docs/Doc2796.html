                     hydepark, Monday
                  â€”I left newyork after lunch Friday following a visit with Madame Marthe de Fels, a French journalist who visits this country every year and who is back here now for a short time. She is a keen observer and tells me that she was surprised at first to find how implicitly a great many people believed in Senator McCarthy's accusations about Communists in our country. Her remark was, "Conditions here are not conducive to the creation of Communists and I have found none myself."
This should be reassuring to those who believe that Senator McCarthy alone can save us from this menace. I cannot help believing that overwhelmingly our people in the government service are not tempted by Communist theories, and outside the government service, I have found remarkably few. It is evident to anyone who visits other areas of the world that the temptation to be a Communist is not present in this country.
It grew cloudier and began to rain before we reached hydepark and by the time I went to dinner with Mrs. Richard Kraut of Poughkeepsie and then to speak for the Vassar Temple Sisterhood about my trips around the world, it was raining in good earnest and we ran from the house to the car.
It was wonderfully quiet and peaceful to wake up in the country Saturday morning and I got up early, since the rain had stopped, and was out with the dogs by 7:30. My snowdrops under the hedge are out and there are little green shoots poking up above the ground in many places, but winter is still too close for me to say that there is a real look of spring. Friday night's rain was warm, however, and I have a feeling that two more weeks will make a very great difference. I cannot be back her...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(16%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic7.html>government president people party democratic state situation made communist newyork</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(14%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>children people school education city program work country money community</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(13%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>morning mrs afternoon back time yesterday night miss washington lunch</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(11%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>house told good beautiful place small land water summer looked</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(11%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic10.html>newyork young year day good hope book called read copyright</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(10%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic6.html>world people country war countries peace part nations great nation</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(8%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>mr city interesting made american great told syndicate gave mrs</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(8%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>people things great time feel man make life find thing</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(6%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>committee part labor united prohibited general organization state government public</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
