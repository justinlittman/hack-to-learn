                  â€”I often come across people who know comparatively little about the type of UNESCO experts who are being used in the united-nations expanded program of technical assistance.
UNESCO is the only agency in the U.N. that provides experts in the field of natural sciences. Of course, the specialist sent in by UNESCO works closely with the scientist of the country that receives his aid, and often the problems worked on are important to economic development.
I heard the story, for instance of some scientific experiments that were carried on in this way which paved the way for an important new industry in Iraq. In this instance it was a Swiss scientist who was sent by UNESCO, and as a result Iraq will soon begin the manufacture of sugar from dates. This development will save the country some $16,000,000 annually which had been spent in importing sugar.
For thousands of years one of the principal foods of the people of Iraq and of the whole region of desert dwellers in Asia and Africa has been dates. Iraq alone possesses 169 varieties and produces about 80 percent of the world's dates. The banks of the Tigris and Euphrates are lined with 35,000,000 palms which spread out into fine forests around Basrah.
As so often happens however when there is a good harvest (and Iraq in good years sometimes has 400,000 tons of dates) prices fall very low, with the result that it is not worthwhile even moving the fruit to market. There are times in Basrah when you can buy a whole ton of dates for four dinars, or $11.20. This worried the directors of Iraq's date association and also worried the head of the UNESCO team of scientists, Dr. Herman Mohler. The latter had been sent to Bagdad in 1951 to help es...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(29%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>children school city education work year community care york schools</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(25%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>people work men women country war labor service great business</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(14%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>world people united country countries war soviet great union states</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(7%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic7.html>york mr american interesting women group interest young city dr</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(7%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>house park beautiful hyde back morning drove place looked told</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(7%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>united nations world part reproduction prohibited general states committee rights</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
