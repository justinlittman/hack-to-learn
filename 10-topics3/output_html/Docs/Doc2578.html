                  â€”In Mycenae you climb up a little way from the road until you come to the driveway which was evidently used by the king's carriages in olden days and then you come to the main gate. The stones of the walls are even bigger than those in Tiryn and the entrance has two heavy stone slabs on the sides and one across the top over which there is inset a conical shaped stone with two lions rampant carved on it.
Once through the gate you come to what I suppose were tombs, on the right.
While we climbed clear up to the top, this was another place where we felt the need of more guidance than the guide book provided.
A man who spoke a little English met us on the way down and he explained that around the tombs there was an elaborate gallery where offerings were made to the gods.
Epidaurus, where we were on Sunday, commemorates Asklipios and it was a great healing center, a sort of Mayo Clinic of its day. There was a big building for teaching, evidently, and some buildings for treatment as well as the long row of buildings where the patients stayed who came to be treated.

On the way down from the main excavations at Mycenae, we stopped at Agamemmnon'sAgamemnon's tomb. The guide book mentioned a number of these conical tombs but this is the grandest of them all. It certainly is an impressive sight on the inside with great big stones going up to a point above you, gradually narrowing down as they reach the top.
