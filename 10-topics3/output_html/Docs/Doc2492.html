                  —In January a year ago Look Magazine published a story about the Veterans Hospital Radio Guild. Now—almost a year and a half later—I want to write something about it in this column.
The work that has been done by a group of professionals in radio work—directors, authors and writers—is nothing short of remarkable, and it follows the line that always pleases me because it helps people to help themselves.
Back in 1948 a group of entertainers going through the wards of hospitals discovered that when the entertainment ended there was a letdown in the day-to-day programs of the patients and they sank back into gloom. In the mind of one of the young women who witnessed this, an idea took shape. She suggested, "Why couldn't we help these veterans do their own entertainment?"
And so this new program was born.
The professionals found that among the veterans there were always some people who could act, write, direct, announce or narrate or do whatever was needed.

Suddenly a man's spirit will revive for his taking part, and such revival is sorely needed when one has spent a year or two in a hospital bed.
When the professional members of the guild first visited some of the members of the future guild who were patients, they were met with bitterness and indifference. Many of these men wanted only to be left alone. What did the future hold for them? Some of them were going to spend the rest of their lives flat on their backs or in wheelchairs. It isn't always easy, if you have lived an active physical life and are young, to discover that there is a life of the mind, and that it can be live...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(22%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>children school city education work year community care york schools</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(21%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>people life day world today years things great country read</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(13%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic7.html>york mr american interesting women group interest young city dr</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(12%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>young home time good boys told find woman things thought</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(12%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic10.html>mrs morning mr washington afternoon time night miss back dinner</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(6%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>people work men women country war labor service great business</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(5%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>house park beautiful hyde back morning drove place looked told</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
