                     new-york, Thursday
                  —Monday evening at a dinner which Mrs. Dick Sporborg gave for me, I was presented by Dr. de Sola Pool with a most interesting volume called "Portraits Etched in Stone—Early Jewish Settlers, 1682 to 1831". This volume covers much of the early history of new-york City.

I knew that I was to receive this book before the dinner, but I had a surprise when Mrs. Sporborg presented me with a beautifully bound book containing the names of all those present who had made a contribution to the American Association of the UNU.N. because of my interest and work there at the present time.
Back at the Association office, I was glad to find that a great many chapters had complied with our request and made budgets for the coming year and plans to raise the budget. Only one chapter felt that the central office should carry some of their responsibilities. I feel that it is essential that all chapters raise their own budgets, since it is only as people feel personal responsibility that they will come to really study the united-nations and try to support it through the organiza...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(27%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic7.html>york mr american interesting women group interest young city dr</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(12%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic10.html>mrs morning mr washington afternoon time night miss back dinner</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(11%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>people life day world today years things great country read</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(11%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>children school city education work year community care york schools</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(9%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>house park beautiful hyde back morning drove place looked told</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(9%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>young home time good boys told find woman things thought</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(9%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>united nations world part reproduction prohibited general states committee rights</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(7%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>world people united country countries war soviet great union states</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
