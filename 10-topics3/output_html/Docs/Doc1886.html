                     GENEVA, Friday
                  â€”I had a letter the other day from a lady whom I take to be young and enterprising. She had just read in the papers a protest against women taking positions in government and asserting that they should stay home in their own kitchens. The article ended with an encomium for Mrs. Truman for minding her own affairs.
The writer ends her letter in this way: "I personally feel that it is the job of every woman to be as good a citizen as she can be, by giving all the time she can spare to public enterprises and the field of politics. It is my feeling also that the kitchen is a good place to formulate these ideas, but one must get far from the kitchen to carry them out."
It seems to me that the lady is right. There are a good many people who must stay at home and who cannot take an active part outside the home. When that is the case they can at least intelligently perform the minimum duties as a citizen and probably no more.
Mrs. Truman has done far more. She has done all that has been expected of the wife of the President and has followed in the footsteps of many fine women who have lived in the whitehouse before her, who were fine wives and mothers and charming hostesses. These are all things that every President's wife must strive to do to the best of her ability.
There are other women, however, who have the time and ability to take as active a part in public affairs as men. When that is the case I think it is well to encourage them to do so and to be grateful that we can have the benefit of the point of view of both men and women in public life. It is essential in home life and nearly all the phases of community activity, so we cannot fail to profit when it is possible to have both men and women active in public life. This is particularly true now...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(24%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>women work men young home war service boys day time</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(12%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>people things great time feel man make life find thing</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(11%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic7.html>government president people party democratic state situation made communist newyork</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(11%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic6.html>world people country war countries peace part nations great nation</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(10%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic10.html>newyork young year day good hope book called read copyright</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(10%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>committee part labor united prohibited general organization state government public</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(9%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>children people school education city program work country money community</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(7%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>mr city interesting made american great told syndicate gave mrs</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
