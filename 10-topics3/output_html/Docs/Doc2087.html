                     PARIS, Tuesday
                  â€”I just received a most welcome gift, Bess Furman's book called, "whitehouse Profile," a social history of the whitehouse, its occupants and its festivities. I have just glanced through it hurriedly and I think it will make fascinating reading. I am going to take it on the flight home just in case I can't sleep the whole way, but I hope it won't be so exciting that it will keep me awake!
We again saw the Palais Chaillot fountains on display and attended a concert given in honor of humanrights Day, which was established three years ago when the Universal Declaration of humanrights was accepted in the General Assembly by 48 nations.
The National Orchestra and the Choir of the French radio gave us a wonderful program, starting with the "Carnaval Romain" by Berlioz, "Prelude a l'Apres-Midi d'un Faune" by Debussy, and "Daphne and Chloe" by Ravel.

I feel that the sovietunion will work with them because I cannot see how she can justify not doing so. What will be arrived at is impossible to foretell, but we may be sure it will be a long and tedious and painful business for this commission and its members. Our prayers should be with them, since on their success hangs much of the future happiness of the world.
I was talking the other day to a young Sicilian artist, Count Massimo Filo Della Torre, who is passionately devoted to the island of Sicily and its people. He is most anxious to visit and lecture in the unitedstates and tell us all about the beauties, the art and the history to be found in Sicily. He wants Americans to come to the Sicilian art festivals and he thinks it is a shame that so many of us go as far as Naples but never to Palermo or Taormina. He brought me a most engaging sam...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(26%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>mr city interesting made american great told syndicate gave mrs</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(16%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>morning mrs afternoon back time yesterday night miss washington lunch</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(13%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>committee part labor united prohibited general organization state government public</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(12%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic10.html>newyork young year day good hope book called read copyright</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(9%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>house told good beautiful place small land water summer looked</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(8%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic6.html>world people country war countries peace part nations great nation</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(6%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>people things great time feel man make life find thing</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
