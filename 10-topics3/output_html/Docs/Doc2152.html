                  â€”Faridabad is one pilot project here which, if it is successful, must be multiplied not hundreds but thousands of times all over India. Strangely enough, the physical plan was made by an American architect, Albert Myer, who works in newyork and only occasionally comes to India.

Each individual living there pays 10 rupees per month or about $2.50 toward these services and the amortization of their debt.
