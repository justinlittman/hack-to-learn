                  â€”I was shocked to read of the attack on a unitednations delegate from the Ukraine in a midtown shop, where a robbery was occurring when he and another member of the delegation went in to buy some fruit. When I asked the Ukrainian representative on Committee 3 about it and heard the details, it seemed almost unbelievable that such a thing could happen practically on 5th Avenue at 11:30 at night.

                  Gregory Stadnik, the victim, is now lying ill in a hospital. As hosts to the UN, we Americans feel grave concern.
