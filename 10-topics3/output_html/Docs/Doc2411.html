One of my very firmest resolutions was that I would have hours of leisure in these coming months but, as I look at my calendar for January and February, it seems to have filled up so rapidly that I don't think I am going to have the leisure hours I had counted on.
Oh, well! Perhaps I wouldn't like them if I had them, so the best New Year's resolution is to be content with whatever comes and to face cheerfully a world in which there will undoubtedly be no security and a great deal of uncertainty for months to come, if not for years.

The latter states so well what Senator Lehman stands for in our community and in the U.S. that I would like to quote from it, as follows:
"...exceptional contributions to the welfare and security of the united-states and the advancement of mankind's struggle for freedom and dignity. Senator Lehman's long and eminent career of high public service has been marked by a deep-laid awareness of the needs of both the present and the future. He has shown a profound understanding of humanity's hopes and aspirations.
