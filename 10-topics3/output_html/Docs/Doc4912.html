                     NEW HAVEN, Conn.
                  â€”We are, of course, deeply concerned by the encircling of Berlin by Communist troops, both Russian and East German. This move on the part of the Soviets is in opposition to all agreements entered into by all the occupying powers, and both Britain and France will back up the American protest.
The belief is that this is one of the first moves on the part of the sovietunion to show that Premier Khrushchev has decided that he must conclude a separate peace treaty with East Germany. He has hoped, of course, that the West would join in a peace treaty recognizing the status quo of Eastern Europe. But the heavy flow of refugees into West Berlin has probably led him to believe that something had to be done, and done immediately.

However, no real timetable had been set up and it was easy for President Bourguiba's friends to say that he was being gullible in believing in any vague French promises. President de Gaulle probably meant to simply protect French nationals and the garrison at Bizerte when he ordered French troops to move in. But, instead of a minimum of casualties, the French soldiers evidently went wild and killed ...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(43%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic7.html>government president people party democratic state situation made communist newyork</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(17%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic6.html>world people country war countries peace part nations great nation</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(14%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>committee part labor united prohibited general organization state government public</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(7%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>mr city interesting made american great told syndicate gave mrs</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(7%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>people things great time feel man make life find thing</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(6%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>house told good beautiful place small land water summer looked</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
