                     Golden Beach, FloridaGOLDEN BEACH, Fla., Tuesday â€”Last night three of us went to a movie. I think it was called "Adam Had Four Sons."

I was interested in a short presentation of some of the boys in the Army and Navy and the entertainment provided for them. It didn't seem to me particularly inspiring, but perhaps I am expecting too much.
