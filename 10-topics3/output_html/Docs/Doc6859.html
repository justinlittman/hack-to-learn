                     WASHINGTON, Tuesdayâ€”We arrived in Washington this morning to find it fairly cool, and my daughter-in-law, Ruth, and I are both delighted. How spoiled one can become when the state of the weather really makes any difference in one's morning outlook. As a matter of fact, both of us were thinking far more about the things we had to do, and how much easier it is to do them when the thermometer does not register 95 degrees in the shade, with corresponding humidity!
I had an appointment this morning with Dr. Valiera Parker, who then went to see Administrator McNutt.

I believe that there is work to be done by every man, woman and child in the country. Some of us can take training which will make us useful in ways that are closely related to military work.
