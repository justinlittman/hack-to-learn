                  â€”My recent visit to Iowa City was a good illustration of the care with which a university plans the schedule of its visiting lecturers. I was called for at 9:40 Wednesday morning. At 10 o'clock we started a radio interview, with a very charming lady, which lasted fifteen minutes.
Iowa State University has a remarkable fine arts department, whose enrollment of graduate students in its schools of music, sculpture, painting and drama is probably the highest of any university in the country. There I was intrigued to see some fascinating African carvings and, as a contrast, two very beautiful Sevres vases.
Following the radio interview, we had an hour's press conference with the regular and university press in attendance. The university paper is an Associated Press paper and has won many prizes. By the time we were through with the press it was 11:40. Many photographs had been taken, including those by a young and ardent photographer who had been given an assignment to follow me during my stay. He started in at breakfast on Wednesday and was on hand when I left on Thursday morning.
The Altrusa Club gave a luncheon in the university Union building, where I was asked to speak a few words. At two o'clock I left and returned to the hotel. At 3:40, Professor H. M. Burian, a delightful person whom Mrs. Dorothy Schramm had enlisted to establish a new chapter of AAUN, came to get me for an hour's meeting at a church hall where, by telephone, they had gathered together a considerable number of people who were anxious to know about the work of the American Association.
