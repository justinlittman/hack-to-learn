This is actually the way Sen. James O. Eastland of Mississippi presented his point of view during a Senate debate on civil rights legislation when he accused Chief Justice Earl Warren of making decisions in favor of the Communists.
A prominent Democrat, Sen. Hubert H. Humphrey, commented that the Chief Justice "is a great American and a courageous and learned judge." A Republican Senator, Kenneth B. Keating of new-york, commented, "However one may disagree with a specific decision of the Supreme Court, I do not consider that it serves a useful purpose to attack the character or motivation of the judge rendering the opinion."
