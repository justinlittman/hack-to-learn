This is actually the way Sen. James O. Eastland of Mississippi presented his point of view during a Senate debate on civil rights legislation when he accused Chief Justice Earl Warren of making decisions in favor of the Communists.
A prominent Democrat, Sen. Hubert H. Humphrey, commented that the Chief Justice "is a great American and a courageous and learned judge." A Republican Senator, Kenneth B. Keating of newyork, commented, "However one may disagree with a specific decision of the Supreme Court, I do not consider that it serves a useful purpose to attack the character or motivation of the judge rendering the opinion."
Senator Eastland would not have us act or think in free and independent fashion. According to him, we must first ascertain what the Soviet opinion is and then we must disagree with it.
This is a weak and idiotic position in which the unitedstates would lack freedom—not the sovietunion. Russia would be making the first decision.

In a one-man hearing of his Senate Judiciary Committee some years ago he dubbed as Communists two Southerners who happened to be against segregation, and one of them had a heart attack as a result.
