                     hyde-parkhyde-park, Mondayâ€”Last week I finally got around to doing two things I have been wanting to do all summer.
One was to visit Bard College. Columbia College has agreed really to consider it as part of its family and the money has been raised to keep it functioning. Therefore, Bard College is now making plans for increasing its usefulness not only to its own students, but to the community around it which has shown so much loyalty and interest.
I was particularly attracted by some of the old pictures of the Bard family and some of the letters and books which form part of an exhibition in the library. I asked them to copy one delightful love letter. For the benefit of those who may never visit Bard College, I shall put it into my column when it reaches me, as a model of the way a gentleman should write to the lady whom he loves.
I was very much struck by the little theatre where the students themselves have done so much practical work in designing scenery, costumes and arranging the necessary lighting, thus actually learning the mechanics of producing a play.

In addition, there are camps for boys and girls of all ages. The youngsters who paraded for us and did various stunts were certainly a healthy, happy look...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(28%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic7.html>york mr american interesting women group interest young city dr</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(18%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>young home time good boys told find woman things thought</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(13%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>people work men women country war labor service great business</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(12%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>children school city education work year community care york schools</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(10%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>house park beautiful hyde back morning drove place looked told</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(7%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>united nations world part reproduction prohibited general states committee rights</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(7%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>people life day world today years things great country read</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
