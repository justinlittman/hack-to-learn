                     new-york.—On Monday in the late afternoon I left new-york by air for Fayetteville, N.C., and on to Fort Bragg. I had not been to Fort Bragg, as far as I could remember, since the early days of the war, and changes that have occurred there are certainly very great. It is now the headquarters of the 18th Airborne Corps as well as the Army installation.
I was rather late in arriving, which must have upset the general and his staff because they are so remarkably prompt in the Army. But they were very kind and took me at once to Holland House, which is one of the guest houses on the post. Lt. Col. Helen H. Bouffier was my hostess during my stay and no one could have been more thoughtful and kind.
Quite naturally, they wanted to show me some of the work that went on there, so we started quite early with a press conference at 8:30 a.m. on Tuesday. At 9:30 the tour of the post began and I went to the Jump School where the paratroopers are trained.
The training of these soldiers is certainly tough—physically, mentally, and emotionally. These people have to control their bodies, their minds and their emotions. Seeing the way they go about this training was very interesting to me. Later I saw barracks, mess halls and hospitals.
Curiously enough, you would expect the hospital to have many accidents cases from jumping. They do have some, but there are far more hospitalized soldiers because of motor accidents than there are because of their jump training.
I was given a book which shows some of the history of the paratroopers as well as the training, and I wish that I had had more time to see more of what is done by this airborne group. By 11:30, however, I had to be prepared to meet with some of the ladies of the women's club who invited me to come to Fort Bragg. After a brief reception we went to lunch and at 1:15 the lecture in the theatre began, which was followed by a tea during which time many of the ladies came up to ask me questions...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(26%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic10.html>mrs morning mr washington afternoon time night miss back dinner</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(20%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic6.html>people government president state york democratic party congress communist power</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(14%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>young home time good boys told find woman things thought</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(11%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>house park beautiful hyde back morning drove place looked told</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(11%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic7.html>york mr american interesting women group interest young city dr</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(8%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>children school city education work year community care york schools</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(5%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>people work men women country war labor service great business</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
