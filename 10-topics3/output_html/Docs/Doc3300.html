                  —I am home from my little jaunt to Rochester and Buffalo. I enjoyed particularly in Buffalo on Thursday my contacts with the State University College for Teachers and the students there, and my meeting on Friday morning with the teachers making up the Western State Federation of N.Y. State.
I had beautiful weather all the time and that made the plane trips enjoyable. On the way home Friday noon I was fortunate to have Mr. Paul Fitzpatrick in the seat beside me and we talked about the days when he used to be in politics and how pleasant it is to be on the sidelines now.

"Your writer wished for you to find another term to use instead of 'housewife.' In filling in questionnaires as to profession, one who writes puts down 'writer;' one who lectures writes 'lecturer'; one who labors writes 'laborer;' one who sings writes 'singer'; one who manages a store writes 'manager'; one who runs a lighthouse writes 'lighthouse keeper'; etc. And, according to you, a woman who runs a house or manages a home should write 'housewife.'
