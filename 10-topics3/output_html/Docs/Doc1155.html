                     newyork, Friday.â€”Christmas Eve again! Tonight at midnight, or thereabouts, many thousands of people throughout our own country and in many other countries of the world will celebrate Christmas as a religious festival and will go to a midnight service.

At this Christmas time in 1948 it behooves each one of us to take a little mental trip throughout the world to see what has happened to the peoples of the world in the past year. We should rejoice with those who have taken steps forward, recognize everywhere the advances that have been made, but check very carefully the work that still needs to be done.
