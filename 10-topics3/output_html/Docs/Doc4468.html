                     newyork.â€”Here I am back after nine interesting days in Puerto Rico. They were interesting to me because for the first time since I can remember I did no work at all! In fact, on many days I did nothing except swim, sit in the sun and read. I slept more than I have slept in years and altogether it was a thoroughly successful holiday.
On three days I looked about the island with an old friend of mine, Adrian Dornbush, who, many years ago when Rex Tugwell went to Puerto Rico as governor, went down to try out some plans for using native materials and developing native hand skills.

One can swim with safety in the areas marked along the beach, and the pool is very large and a marvelous place for young and old alike. Puerto Ricans come on Saturdays and Sundays as members of the beach club in fairly large numbers, and they are wonderful with their children, taking infinite pains to teach them to swim and dive.
