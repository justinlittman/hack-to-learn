                  —Among several things in the newspapers during the last few days that have interested me greatly, the most thrilling was the story of a new artificial arm developed by Samuel Alderson, research physicist, in the International Business Machines laboratory, at the instigation of Thomas J. Watson, IBM head.
Early in the war, I saw the latest things that the Navy had developed at a hospital in san-francisco. It seemed to me that artificial legs were far less of a handicap than arms. You could learn to walk again even if you had two artificial legs, and I have seen people who, after sufficient practice, could get up and down stairs and walk on a level without using a cane. But an artificalartificial arm—that seemed to be a very great handicap.
This new development will apparently give control of every section of the arm, which is worked by a tiny electric motor. The newspaper story said that heavy labor would not be possible with this new device, but that ordinary things could be done and a man could handle freely anything weighing up to five pounds.
The arm is equipped with cables, hidden inside, which act as do human muscles. The different functions—elbow bend, wrist motion and finger grip—are controlled by gears which are thrown into position by shoulder movements.
I think the development of this mechanism will do a great deal for the rehabilitation of many wounded men, and I am not surprised to find that people like Representative Edith Nourse Rogers, Surgeon General Norman T. Kirk and, finally, Thomas J. Watson have been pushing the research that led to it. When Mr. Watson heard about Mr. Alderson's experiments, which had been begun during the war, he invited him to continue them at his laboratory in Endicott, N. Y., and set aside funds for the pr...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(24%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>children school city education work year community care york schools</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(15%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>people work men women country war labor service great business</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(12%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>young home time good boys told find woman things thought</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(10%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic7.html>york mr american interesting women group interest young city dr</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(10%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>united nations world part reproduction prohibited general states committee rights</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(8%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>house park beautiful hyde back morning drove place looked told</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(7%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>people life day world today years things great country read</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(7%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic6.html>people government president state york democratic party congress communist power</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(5%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>world people united country countries war soviet great union states</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
