                     hydeparkhydepark, unremarkableN. Y. Fridayâ€”At last we have had a little gentle rain. Of course, it wouldn't satisfy either the farmers or the garden lovers, but it is a help. For that reason, I didn't complain at all when I found myself driving through a misty rain most of the time yesterday afternoon, which, around Brewster, N. Y., developed into a regular downpour for about half an hour.
For weeks we have been promising ourselves a drive through Connecticut and a visit with our friends Esther Lape and Elizabeth Read in Westbrook, Conn., but one thing and another has turned up and we kept putting it off. I looked at Miss Thompson's desk and at mine yesterday and realized what one day of neglect could do. I was almost inclined to think that it was better never to leave home.

Even in the villages where there used to be a continuous line of old trees, there seemed to be a few old ones left and the young ones are coming up, so that the village greens will soon be shaded again.

They have a nice view out from under the trees across the marshland to the gently moving marshy river and I don't wonder that they enjoy going down there for lunch.
We had a very pleasant evening unremarkableand got up at an early hour this morning and left for the homeward drive at eight-fifteen. I find New Haven, Conn., perfectly impossible to get through without being lost, so we tried a road which is a little longer but completely ecapes escapes New Haven. It took us no longer to get home.
I suppose I had better make a confession. I was stopped by a highway patrol officer yesterday. My boys have always said that it would give them great satisfaction if I would be arrested and I think yesterday I came very near receiving more than the gentle reprimand which was given to me. I had been talking and apparently not watching my speedometer, so I was firmly convinced that I had never gone over 45, and the patrol officer quite as firmly told me I was going 60, and that 50 was "tops...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(35%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>morning mrs afternoon back time yesterday night miss washington lunch</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(23%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>house told good beautiful place small land water summer looked</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(13%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>people things great time feel man make life find thing</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(11%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>women work men young home war service boys day time</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
