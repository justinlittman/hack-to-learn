                     NEW YORK, Thursday
                  â€”It is rather sad to find a Senate committee refusing to recommend the reappointment of Leland Olds for a third term on the Federal Power Commission. And since the refusal seems to rest in part at least on the grounds that he is tinged with communism makes the whole thing seem ridiculous. I can only say that this accusation must be a cloak to hide the real reasons.
Can people be fooled by such flimsy accusations?
I was glad to see in the newspapers that Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas may be able to leave the hospital in about two weeks. I know how much he has always loved his native Northwest and the mountains in which he was riding. It seems a shame that on the last day of vacation he should have suffered such an accident. His many friends are glad to hear that he is improving.
During the last few days the papers seem to be full of people who have had accidents or illnesses. I was shocked to see what a serious operation Senator Vandenberg had undergone. I am sure his devotion to duty kept him from giving in to the illness at an earlier date. One can only wish him well and hope that he will gradually regain his strength.
The Republicans in the Senatorial campaign in New York State are not letting the grass grow under their feet. I have seldom seen such a vigorous and well-planned number of campaign trips as seem to be covering "upstate," but I regret that the issue primarily stressed seems to be the fear of communism.
This does not seem to me to be as serious a discussion of the real issues involved as the state is entitled to hear from two such able candidates for the United States Senate. Governor Lehman and Mayor O'Dwyer are planning intensive campaigns and I hope in both cases that they will, first, ask the voters to look at their records, which can bear scrutiny and which do them credit. Secondly, I trust both will formulate clear and unequivocal programs so the voters will know what to count on ...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(35%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>world united people nations states government country countries peace part</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(20%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>people day men war things life great time today man</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(19%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>york mr united women young meeting group american feature city</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(17%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>mrs morning house back yesterday afternoon time night miss washington</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(10%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>people work children country public education school labor syndicate money</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
