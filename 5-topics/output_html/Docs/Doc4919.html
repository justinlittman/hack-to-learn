                     HYDE PARK.â€”Our New York City newspapers report that because of a sharp rise in unemployment insurance benefits this year New York State employers are facing an 85-million-dollar rise in unemployment insurance taxes starting January 1. And this condition probably holds in other states around the country.
Automation inevitably will increase unemployment, and for longer periods, because we are still lacking in careful planning to meet the new conditions. When automation cuts into the employment rolls, training periods should be made available immediately for those dismissed from their jobs, and industry should plan ahead of time for new services and new businesses where the slack of unemployment can be taken up after training.
In years gone by too-distant planning was not considered so important. When new labor-saving devices were introduced, new occupations would invariably spring up. But automation moves more swiftly and puts a far greater number of people out of work. And with changed conditions it will probably be essential to change the methods for handling these conditions.
If we do not attack the basic causes of unemployment we are sure to find that the cost will continue to grow, so I hope we will begin to realize that new conditions require new thinking.
On September 19 a new session of the United Nations General Assembly will begin. And this promises to be a very important meeting when a great many vital issues will be brought up for discussion.
