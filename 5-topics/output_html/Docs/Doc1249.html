                     NEW YORK, Wednesday
                  —Yesterday was a beautiful day at Hyde Park and a great number of friends gathered for the memorial services.
There was a wreath from the people of France, sent up by the French Gratitude Train, which Drew Pearson placed on my husband's grave at the same time as the wreath from the board of the Memorial Foundation. There were other wreaths as well and there were representatives present from many groups and societies. Later in the day the Liberian delegation to the United Nations brought a wreath and placed it on the grave.

His confidence that in two years' time we may hope to feel assured of world peace is certainly something I am very glad to hear. I hope ways may be found to bring us that security even sooner, for I cannot believe that sensible peoples—no matter where they are in the world—really want to continue this jittery performance of suspicion which may lead to war.
It seems rather amusing that one of the first moves to help get the President's program under way has come from five Republican Senators. They seem anxious to have the Displaced Persons Act liberalized.
Whether it will make the Democrats happy to know that Senator Pat McCarran, of Nevada, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, has a letter from the Republican members "respectfully urging" that he go forward with his long pending bipartisan amendments to the law is a moot question. Nevertheless, those of us who want to see something done about the law cannot help being glad to have this unforeseen aid. I keep getting the most heartbreaking letters from people in Europe, good people...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(31%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>people day men war things life great time today man</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(29%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>world united people nations states government country countries peace part</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(15%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>people work children country public education school labor syndicate money</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(13%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>york mr united women young meeting group american feature city</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(12%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>mrs morning house back yesterday afternoon time night miss washington</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
