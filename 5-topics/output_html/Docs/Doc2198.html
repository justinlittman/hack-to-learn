When I arrived at Miss Hurst's apartment the roof was leaking, so we all went down to Mr. Pogany's studio and had tea. He has a very charming wife and has done many portraits of her, which hang in the studio. I must say I enjoyed seeing his work.

She is a sweet little thing with a wonderful disposition. She never cried at all. She was dressed in the same christening dress that I wore.
