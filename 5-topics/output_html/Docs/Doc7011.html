                     New York CityNEW YORK, Thursdayâ€”Yesterday was a rather leisurely day in Washington. A few friends came to lunch and, at 3:00 o'clock, I went down to the Library of Congress. There, the Pan-American Coffee Bureau, presented to the division in charge of records, the recordings of my Sunday night broadcasts.

They are making their own machines and gradually working away from the entirely han-made handmade dproducts.

Several people came in during the afternoon, and I spoke in the evening at a meeting for the freign foreign born, sponsored by the Civilian Defense Volunteer Office, of which Mrs. Winthrop W. Aldrich is chairman.

By then, perhaps, both tires and oil will be so well rationed, that few people will use any vehicle except for absolutely necessary work. Even if we had to drain the water out of our cars every night, I imagine we could manage.
