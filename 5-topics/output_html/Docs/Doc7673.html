                     WASHINGTON, Tuesday â€”In National Red Cross Headquarters the other
morning, I looked at some familiar pictures. An exhibition of
paintings done in New Guinea, which I had seen in Australia, was displayed.
Some of them, of course, were done by men who were artists or
illustrators in civilian life. Some were done by men who never before
had painted anything. All of them are interesting, both in subject
matter, which shows so well the artists' present living conditions,
and in the material and techniques used.
The only prize that was offered was the promise that the paintings
would be exhibited in this country, and I hope that anyone who happens
to be in Washington will wander into the lobby of the Red Cross
building and see the work.
I had hoped that these paintings would be sent to other galleries
in the country, for I am sure that many people would like to see
these vivid impressions from men in the fighting forces, particularly
if their own men happen to be in a similar area. I am told, however,
that the artists in many cases want them delivered as soon as
possible to their families. In other cases, the paintings have already
been sold and the buyers are anxious to acquire possession. So I fear
that the present exhibition is all that will be possible.
In addition, I understand that Frederick Douglas Greenbowe, a member
of a Marine raider group, has sent a number of crayon and pencil
drawings which he made on one of the combat islands in the Pacific,
back to the Red Cross. They will shortly be on exhibition, so I am
looking forward to seeing these and hope they may be shown in other
cities as well.
Incidentally, while we were on Galapagos, one of the officers wrote
some verses inspired by a Navy commander's pets, two iguanas, which I
mentioned to you before. The verses amused me and I am sure they will
amuse you, so with the author's permission I quote them here:
