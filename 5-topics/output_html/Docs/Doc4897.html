                     HYDE PARK.â€”I am glad that President Kennedy has taken to the people the question of his long-range foreign aid program. Any sensible businessman or woman knows that a program that gives assurance of only one year's backing is a wasteful program.
You cannot make plans far enough in advance so that a project that takes over a year for completion can be carried out unless there is some assurance that funds will be on hand. When you know that year by year certain needed sums will be available the best way to get things done can be planned. Thus, there will be much less waste and much better planning.
Our dealings with our neighbors, particularly in Latin America, have been hampered by this situation of being unable to pledge support over a period of years, so that particular plans could not be carried out to full fruition. With the expanded program, which is meant to really help nations to move forward to a point where their economies will be self-supporting, long-range plans are absolutely essential.
It is gratifying to find the President explaining his program to the people, and I am sure he will get the support he asks.
One of the arguments constantly brought up as regards the sincerity of the United States in desiring disarmament is the point that our economy could not stand giving up the continuation of full military production. And very important to the over-alloverall picture on disarmament was the statement made in Geneva by Mr. Adlai Stevenson, who heads our delegation.
In a speech before the Economic and Social Council he said that an accord to limit arms would provide the opportunity to turn "our resources from production of instruments of death to the production of the manifold things we need for a better life for our own citizens and for the citizens of other nations."
In his speech he recognized the fact that a change-over period that comes abruptly nearly always causes a time of disruption, but if it is planned for it can be accomplished very quickly and the difficulties can be minimized.
I was interested to read that Mr. Stevenson said such plans are really being considered in Washington. I hope they will be carried out to the point where business, particularly the big business of mass production for war, will know exactly step by step what they will be able to do and what world needs they will begin to fill. There are needs all over the world crying out for consideration, and I don't believe we have reached the point of pinpointing what our great industries could do if...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(40%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>world united people nations states government country countries peace part</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(35%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>people work children country public education school labor syndicate money</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(10%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>people day men war things life great time today man</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(9%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>york mr united women young meeting group american feature city</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(5%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>mrs morning house back yesterday afternoon time night miss washington</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
