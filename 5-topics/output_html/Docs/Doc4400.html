                     HYDE PARK.—The opening of the 90-day celebration to commemorate Henry Hudson's discovery of the Hudson River took place this week in New York City.

This year marks the 350th anniversary of Henry Hudson's arrival at the mouth of the Hudson River, and New York and New Jersey are both playing a part.

Mr. William Zeckendorf, president of New York City's Hudson Celebration Committee, was master of ceremonies.
How interesting it is to read that two portraits of Thomas Jefferson have just been found—and both on the same canvas!

The whole story of how the canvas was found, and of the patient work done by Orland Campbell, is most interesting.
The other night I attended a meeting in Harlem to start off a new neighborhood association which is endeavoring to bring together the people of the area in the hope of improving conditions. In this section of New York City housing is very badly overcrowded, buildings are allowed to deteriorate, and children grow up with little pride in their surroundings, which is one reason for them becoming very destructive of property.
An area such as Harlem costs the residents of the rest of the city more money than would a good community, because the major part of all taxes has to be spent on the needs of the people who live in an area of this kind. As a rule there are more crimes and more illness, the schools are poorer, and mental health generally is at its lowest ebb in such areas. It would pay the citizens of New York City as a whole to take an interest in backing up a group like the Harlem Neighborhood Associati...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(29%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>york mr united women young meeting group american feature city</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(29%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>people work children country public education school labor syndicate money</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(21%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>mrs morning house back yesterday afternoon time night miss washington</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(11%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>world united people nations states government country countries peace part</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(11%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>people day men war things life great time today man</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
