This is actually the way Sen. James O. Eastland of Mississippi presented his point of view during a Senate debate on civil rights legislation when he accused Chief Justice Earl Warren of making decisions in favor of the Communists.
A prominent Democrat, Sen. Hubert H. Humphrey, commented that the Chief Justice "is a great American and a courageous and learned judge." A Republican Senator, Kenneth B.
