                     Hyde ParkHYDE PARK, Mondayâ€”I have a letter from a woman in Michigan, the mother of a son who is now serving on foreign soil, and another boy alreadyin the service. She asks that I draw her suggestion to the attention of my readers and I am very glad to do so.
Mrs. Johnson, of Ironwood, Michigan, feels, that in planning for peace, mothers of boys in our services and German mothers and Russian mothers could sit down and discuss certain broad phases of the promotion of good willgoodwill among nations in the future, perhaps more easily and more realistically than the diplomats and economists who are usually in evidence when such plans are being formulated.
I do not know that I would limit it only to mothers. I think I would say many women with sons, husbands and friends serving overseas, have a deep interest in this question of preventing wars in the future. Mrs. Johnson suggests that the diplomatic and economic questions shouldnot be a part of the women's discussion, but I feel that, perhaps the women should set themselves to studying all the questions that must form a basis for peace.
Merely generating good willgoodwill, which will make women willing to work together, is not going to be enough. We shall have to know how nations will be fed and built up again into self-supporting units which can help to build up and support the other nations in the world. We are a family of nations and need each other to live well. Weshall have to be able to understand the economic questions underlying all diplomatic understandings, for good willgoodwill can never exist unless it is built...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(28%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>people day men war things life great time today man</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(27%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>world united people nations states government country countries peace part</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(23%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>york mr united women young meeting group american feature city</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(19%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>people work children country public education school labor syndicate money</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
