                     HYDE PARK, Friday
                  —I came back to Hyde Park last night. My two little dogs were awaiting me. They knew, the minute they were brought to my house from my superintendent's house, that something was going to happen. I was told that they stayed gazing out the window toward the road or kept their noses glued to the front door, so they would not miss anything.

He is executive secretary of the interim commission of the World Health Organization. A psychiatrist of worldwide distinction, he has chosen "A New Look at Child Health" as the subject of his speech.
