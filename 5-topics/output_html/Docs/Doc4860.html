                     NEW YORK.—It is certainly almost breathtaking to think that a man flew into space and was gone 108 minutes circling the earth and during the trip talked to the ground by radio.
I don't know, of course, what this means to scientists. It means little of interest to me except that the world is becoming smaller and smaller. In time, I suppose, we will find some real reason for wanting to communicate with the other planets—if there are human beings living on them. It will be exciting to find if their ways of life are better and more interesting than ours and it will certainly add new dimensions to our whole existence.
The fact that we in the United States should not be prepared to send a man into space as yet seems to me quite unimportant. This is the kind of thing in any case which should be under the sponsorship of the United Nations and information which is of value should be shared by all nations.
I am sure that there are matters of climate and perhaps many things which I do not know about which should be of value to the world as a whole, and this should certainly not be controlled by one nation alone.
That is why it seems to me important that agreements should be reached in the U.N. and that all information should be centered there for the use of the world as a whole.
We certainly congratulate the Soviet Union and can quite understand that the students at Moscow University held a celebration.
The Soviets, naturally, have great pride in being first to achieve scientific advances which some of us look upon as more or less incomprehensible developments but which we feel sure will eventually have more meaning to all of us.
I think there is a growing feeling in this country that the attitude taken by President Charles deGaullede Gaulle toward the U.N. is one that will do a great deal of harm.
No one feels that the U.N. is perfect in every detail of its present organization, but certainly the accusations levelled against it by President deGaullede Gaulle are not going to help to improve it. At the same time the withholding by France of its share of the expenses in the Congo weakens the organization, which even President deGaullede Gaulle acknowledges is "a great world undertaking" which he would like to see resumed on "a new basis."
He is helping to weaken it in just the way the Russians would like to see it weakened. And if you destroy something it is very rarely resumed on a better basis.
France is among those countries that have suffered most in war on its own soil in the past, and one would think that the people of France and their leaders would be more aware than almost any other people of the value of the machinery which helps us to delay wars—small wars or big wars. Because of their pride as a nation, the French have insisted on going on developing their own nuclear power, not realizing that probably they were encouraging every small European nation to hope that ...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(58%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>world united people nations states government country countries peace part</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(18%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>people work children country public education school labor syndicate money</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(11%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>people day men war things life great time today man</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(8%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>york mr united women young meeting group american feature city</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(5%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>mrs morning house back yesterday afternoon time night miss washington</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
