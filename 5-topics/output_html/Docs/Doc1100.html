                     PARIS, Thursday
                  â€”I mentioned the other day that I have been receiving a great many letters about prisoners, mainly political prisoners, who themselves or whose families felt that they were put under arrest unfairly. At first I did not understand why these letterletters should be addressed to me. Later, however, I found little notices in the newspapers and magazines that stated, as chairman of the Human Rights Commission, I was the one to receive such appeals.
Therefore, I think I should clear up for the general public the idea that petitions or appeals of this kind can be handled by the Human Rights Commission.
This commission is not a court. There is as yet no machinery set up to handle petitions of any kind. What we, as a commission, have been given to do is very simple. We have been asked to write a Bill of Human Rights.
We decided that this bill should be in two parts, one the declaration and one the covenant. It was decided also that the covenant, being a legal document and having to be ratified by each nation individually, should also have included in it methods for its implementation.

It merely sets certain standards for human rights, it states goals that we wish to achieve throughout the world, and it has a moral value because governments accepting it in the General Assembly will feel morally bound to strive at least to make a beginning toward these goals.

                  Some daySomeday there may be the necessary machinery under the covenant to receive and to act on petitions, but I do not have any idea when that machinery will be ready or what it will be. At the present time there is none, and there is nothing that I, as an individual, or the Human Rights Commission, as a group, can do to ascertain the rights or wrongs of any case. There is still open to the citizens the normal government channels in their own countries, but as yet th...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(33%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>world united people nations states government country countries peace part</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(24%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>people day men war things life great time today man</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(20%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>mrs morning house back yesterday afternoon time night miss washington</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(13%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>york mr united women young meeting group american feature city</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(9%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>people work children country public education school labor syndicate money</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
