                  â€”Something I deplore in this country is the fact that we occasionally find people here and there who allow themselves to be carried away by hysterical fear. The minute they indulge in this kind of fear they revert at once to thinking in the way people thought in the late 19th century. We thought then only in terms of force.
The men who began to think in terms of peaceful settlements among nations and a gradual growth of mutual understanding were always men who were not easily moved by fear. They were willing to move slowly and cautiously and to try to bring about solutions to difficult situations without resort to force.
There is a case in point before us at the present time.
It is highly unpleasant to find diplomatic officials or travelling  businessmen or military men sent on missions to disturbed areas of the world being imprisoned within those danger spots. Our State Department, not being moved by fear, has gone very calmly about using peaceful pressures to achieve results which, admittedly, might be gained by a show of military power. Some people, motivated by fear in this country, have loudly protested that we were allowing insults to be heaped upon us.
