                  .â€”On going up to Hyde Park this past week endweekend I learned that in my own home locality I had been very negligent as a citizen. There had been a vote on the school budget, and I had not even known about it!
Of course, the notice to voters and some comments were in our local newspapers, but I often put off reading them until I collect several. And no one had drawn my attention to the fact that the new school budget is highly controversial.
