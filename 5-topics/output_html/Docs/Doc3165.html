                     NEW YORK.
                  â€”Someone gave me the other day a most-imaginative poem written by Josephine Young Case. It is about a part of the country that she knows well. Published back in 1938, I still think it is a book that bears re-readingrereading in 1955.
Miss Case calls her poem "At Midnight on the 31st of March." What it recounts is an emergency, an imaginative one, but which tested the calibre of all who lived in the community. In a dream they met this emergency and lived a year, and these are the words that John Herbert, one of the characters who became a leader, spoke on the last night of the year:
A similar dream might help us all to meet the present!
I read recently that our government is not going to favor the reform of the calendar because of the feeling that from the religious standpoint many groups would be seriously upset by any change. I realize all the arguments in favor of this change, but I think the arguments against it are the stronger and I am glad we are not going to squabble at length about it.
