                     NEW YORK.â€”In a way this is a sad column, and yet in another way it should be a song of triumph. To those of us who knew and loved Adele Rosenwald Levy, who died on Saturday night of last week, it will seem for a long time as though something very good had gone out of life. But, on the other hand, how few people leave this world with as triumphant a record!
Adele Levy had great opportunities because she had been well-educated, she was endowed with fine traits of heart and mind and, above everything else, she had a tradition of responsibility for other people in the world.
This made her use her worldly possessions as a trust. She carried on the family feeling in the tradition that her father and mother laid down, but she carried forward for herself a sense of obligation and dedication to the public service which very few men or women living today will surpass. She gave to her family and to her friends a loving loyalty, and to her husband a love and devotion that brought to both of them, I am sure, great happiness.
So, on a personal basis, her loss is sheer tragedy and she will be missed not only as a citizen in her own city and in her own state and country but as a citizen of the world, for she cared about humanity as a whole.

Her life will, I am sure, inspire others to work harder to carry through the things for which she felt it was worthwhile spending her own energy and her great gifts. I hope those of us who worked with her can continue to do something worthy in her memory.
While I speak of those who have left us recently, I would like to say a word as well about Morris Llewellyn Cooke. He had not been active for many years but he was a great engineer and, above all, a very fine man. My husband trusted him and was always happy when he could get him to carry out some piece of work in Washington. The country lost in him another able and good citizen, and one can only hope that his family and friends will find their sorrow lessened by the knowledge that his wa...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(41%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>people day men war things life great time today man</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(21%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>york mr united women young meeting group american feature city</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(15%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>mrs morning house back yesterday afternoon time night miss washington</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(14%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>people work children country public education school labor syndicate money</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(9%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>world united people nations states government country countries peace part</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
