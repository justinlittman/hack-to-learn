                     BELGRADE, YUGOSLAVIABELGRADE, Yugoslavia
                  â€”I was assigned as interpreter in Belgrade a very charming young woman, Mrs. Yovanka Lukic, who interprets as a rule for the President's wife. I feel a little guilty about it because at a dinner given by Mr. Wallner of our Embassy on the night of our arrival, Mrs. Vilfan told me she had to leave by train that night in order to interpret at some interviews with the President's wife. It is certainly kind of the Yugoslav government to put themselves out so much.
The dinner at the Embassy was very pleasant and after dinner Mr. Crnobrnja told me a little about the economic methods of running industrial plants here. I shall know more about this in the course of the next few days.
At dinner Mr. Pijade was most interesting in talking about his work in the legislature.
At 8:30 Tuesday morning Mr. Vilfan and Dr. Ribnikar came with the proposed schedule and I think we will start out on our travels Thursday morning.
Tuesday morning Miss Corr and I devoted to catching up on necessary work but at 1 o'clock we were at Mr. Dedijer's home. I met his mother for the first time and was very much impressed by her beauty. I had been told that she headed many women's organizations, particularly the Red Cross, and that she was very active, but I had not realized she had been to the USU.S. and knew Miss KatherineKatharine Lenroot and Dr. Martha Eliot of our Children's Bureau. She came to the USU.S. some years ago...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(32%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>york mr united women young meeting group american feature city</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(29%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>mrs morning house back yesterday afternoon time night miss washington</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(20%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>people work children country public education school labor syndicate money</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(11%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>world united people nations states government country countries peace part</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(9%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>people day men war things life great time today man</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
