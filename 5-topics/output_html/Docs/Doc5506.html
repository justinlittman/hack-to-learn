                     SAN FRANCISCO, Friday
                  â€”I promised that I'd tell something about this trip, for it has been rather an amusing and eventful one.
From Cleveland to Chicago everything went smoothly, except that our youngest passenger, aged seven months, found the trip not to her liking, and told us so vociferously. I always have thought girl babies had better lungs than boys, and this one proved it. She never stopped! I was almost more sorry for her poor mother, who worried about the rest of the passengers, than I was for the baby herself, though there were moments when I thought she would burst.

She had no one with her in the passenger compartment, but her father was the co-pilot and she was returning to her mother in Salt Lake City. He came out once and brought her down to introduce her to me. She took the introduction solemnly and with very little interest, but after he returned to the pilot's compartme...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(60%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>mrs morning house back yesterday afternoon time night miss washington</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(15%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>york mr united women young meeting group american feature city</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(13%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>people day men war things life great time today man</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(8%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>people work children country public education school labor syndicate money</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
