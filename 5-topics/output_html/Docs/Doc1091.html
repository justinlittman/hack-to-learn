                     PARIS, Monday
                  —On Friday I went to a most interesting luncheon given by W. Averell Harriman, American special representative in Europe of the European Recovery Program. Our representatives in various Western European countries and trade union leaders from all those countries came to Paris to meet Secretary of State George C. Marshall and to hear him speak.
I was happy to be able to attend the luncheon but distressed because I had to leave at a quarter to three so as to be at the opening of the General Assembly meeting in the afternoon.
The French people cannot understand why one needs to hurry over a meal. What Mr. Harriman expected to be a short luncheon became a traditional French meal with many courses. It isn't really that you get more to eat, but what you get is served in separate courses and the process of eating it is long and drawn out.
This does not mean that the food here is cheap and plentiful. It does mean that when the French entertain they make a tremendous effort, and here in this city if you spend enough money you can get what you want.
I suppose that could be said of almost any big city in the world but that doesn't seem quite right when one feels as I do. The economic base is far from stable here and there is unrest among the people just because they can see how wide a difference there is between what they have and what one may obtain if only one's bank account is big enough.
In spite of its inconveniences I think the equality of drabness is what makes up the strength of the British Isles. There are some exceptions even there, of course, but by and large from the King down to the simplest workingman certain rules apply equally.
The children of Great Britain, on the whole, are better fed than ever before, but of course there is a discipline among the people there that I do not think exists in any other country of the world. It does not exist here in Paris, and I do not think it exists with us in America. In the countries of Eastern Europe it may exist, but most of us know little about that.
Back at the Palais de Chaillot, Committee Three reported the first item on its agenda—the convention on narcotic drugs—to the General Assembly. The convention was passed unanimously, so there is strong hope that all the nations will sign it immediately and then we can feel that the many new synthetic drugs, which can be manufactured so easily, will be controlled for man's good and not allowed to do the harm that they might easily do. One factory could make enough of these new drugs to ...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(35%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>world united people nations states government country countries peace part</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(21%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>mrs morning house back yesterday afternoon time night miss washington</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(18%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>york mr united women young meeting group american feature city</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(13%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>people day men war things life great time today man</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(13%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>people work children country public education school labor syndicate money</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
