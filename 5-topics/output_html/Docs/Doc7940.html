                     NEW YORK, Fridayâ€”Having gone to The Tuition Plan luncheon yesterday without knowledge as to what the organization represented, I found that the plan meant an easier way to pay month by month for the education of our children.

The speeches were extremely interesting, but as so often happens, they left me with an unsatisfied feeling.
