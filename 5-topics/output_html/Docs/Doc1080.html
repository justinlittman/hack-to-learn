                     PARIS, Tuesday
                  â€”Before leaving the United States, I was told by Miss Katharine Lenroot, chief of the Children's Bureau of the Department of Labor, that if I would look up Jack Fasteau, social welfare attache at our Embassy here, he would be able to tell me many things of interest about the living conditions of the French people in these postwar days.
Fortunately for me, my trip to the Luxembourg on Sunday provided me with much conversation material, and when I called Mr. Fasteau yesterday I was delighted to learn that he would come in for tea.

A workingman's only salvation, it seems, lies in the fact that rents have been frozen at their pre-warprewar levels. At the present time most of the people here are able to cover their rent by utilizing only about one percent of the family income.
