                     PORTLAND, Ore.
                  —New York's intelligent and discriminating voters once again elected Mayor Robert F. Wagner. Also, the new city charter and court reform won approval.
In fact, I think the Mayor has received so much backing that now it is up to him to show the people how a strong and purposeful man can use this backing. In the early part of January I should like to see a review of the various departments of New York City government showing that each head of a department had gone through his employees with an eye to greater efficiency and loyalty to the new program promised by the Mayor.
If this is done, I feel sure that we shall soon see some real improvements in the city, principally the elimination of graft that led to the scandals which bedevilled previous administrations when the Mayor was not in full command. He now can show the people of New York City that he intends to make the improvements he has promised. Everyone of us is obligated, I think, to back him wholeheartedly and cooperate in any way he asks to make his task, which is not an easy one, a successful one.
I am also very happy about the victory in New Jersey of the Democratic candidate for Governor, Richard J. Hughes. These two Democratic successes—in New York City and in New Jersey—show a strengthening for our national leadership under President Kennedy and for his policies.
Mayor Wagner is now in a position to reorganize the state Democratic organization. I hope he will find some young and energetic chairman who will really capitalize on the many issues the Democratic party at present should bring home to the people in demonstrating its superior ability to meet the challenges both at home and abroad.
My warm congratulations go to Mayor Wagner and to New Jersey's Governor-elect Richard J. Hughes.
Former Sen. Herbert H. Lehman contributed greatly to Mayor Wagner's success, but, even more, he has shown his wisdom and leadership of the reform Democratic group. I hope under Mayor Wagner's leadership the reform group will now fight with its full energy to bring about the results it desires in the areas where it has the power to do so.
I have just received some information on the way the various departments in the Federalfederal government responded to the President's appeal for recommendations as to how to save money and come nearer to a balanced budget. I have long been taught that jeopardizing the economy of our country was a dangerous thing to do from the point of view of national defense as well as from our own personal interest and so I recognize fully the need for economy, but I think I differ somewhat as to w...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(43%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>people work children country public education school labor syndicate money</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(31%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>world united people nations states government country countries peace part</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(13%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>york mr united women young meeting group american feature city</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(8%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>people day men war things life great time today man</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
