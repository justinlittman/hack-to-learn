                     HYDE PARK, Friday
                  â€”Late Tuesday evening I left here with the purpose of keeping two early appointments in New York. The first was with a lady at 9 A.M.a.m. after which I attended a meeting of the American Association for the United Nations.
Wednesday afternoon I took the plane for Martha's Vineyard to spend the night with my friends, Mr. and Mrs. Joseph P. Lash, and returned to New York Thursday in time to take the evening train back to Hyde Park.

I can't help believing it would be a more effective job, and better understood, if our government could put in some very able Point 4 administrators who would help in the tangible problems that confront the people in the whole of Indo-China.
If we could show that we had raised the standard of living, I think it would have greater effect than any words we can invent to tell the story of conditions in Communist China.
There seems to be more and more difficulty about agreement on the European Defense Community treaty. Nobody knows exactly what the final decision of the French Assembly will be nor what Sir Winston Churchill actually means by saying that he will do all he can to help. But in this country we have felt, and still feel, that Europe needs to be economically bound together and also to be a military unit. It is true that even in this country there is some fear of a rearmed Germany.
