                     Hyde ParkHYDE PARK, Fridayâ€”We were a bit hurried after we reached Worcester, Mass., yesterday afternoon. To begin with, I was a little late in arriving. It hadn't occurred to me that I would find some people waiting outside in the rain, together with several policemen, and an agitated group of ladies within the hotel doorway. Such was the case, however, but the ladies were very sweet about my tardiness.
We had a hasty press conference and then, on being told that we would go to the broadcasting studio, I remembered that I still was wearing a plain blue beret and had left my hat in the car.

I had come through a town and was horribly conscious of the fact that I had driven in a stupid fashion and stalled my car at a cross-section, but I did not think I had done anything wrong. Suddenly, a red car driven by someone in uniform shot past me. It pulled up in front of me and the driver waved me to stop. My heart sank and I thought: "Well, I unconsciously ran through a red light in New Haven once, I have probably done the same thing her...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(64%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>mrs morning house back yesterday afternoon time night miss washington</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(15%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>york mr united women young meeting group american feature city</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(14%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>people day men war things life great time today man</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
