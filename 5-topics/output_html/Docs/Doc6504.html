                     Hyde ParkHYDE PARK, Mondayâ€”I am beginning to think that all the Chautauqua organizations have chosen charming spots for their settlements. We drove out to Chautauqua, Ohio, straight from the train yesterday and, as we drove into this summer resort, we passed gay parties and boats on the Miami River. The big swimming pool and tennis courts were crowded with young people. The cottages looked unpretentious, but attractive and comfortable.
I could not help thinking that it was an ideal place for children and young people to spend a healthy, pleasant summer. The audience was large and most attentive and the questions showed real interest in the subject, though there were a few personal ones like: " Is the color on your hat Eleanor Blue?"

The ride was not very satisfactory because the flies bother the horses so much. I shall be glad when this particularly "buggy" season is over and we can use the woods again.

Wilson, Chief of the Secret Service, telling me that during the past year the United States Secret Service has been trying to make the American public "counterfeit conscious",," and thereby to suppress the major crime of counterfeiting. They have used all the known ways to educate people through publicity and have succeeded in reducing the losses of the American people through counterfeiting from $1,151,839 in 1936 to $197,381 for the...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(35%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>mrs morning house back yesterday afternoon time night miss washington</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(24%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>people day men war things life great time today man</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(21%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>york mr united women young meeting group american feature city</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(12%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>people work children country public education school labor syndicate money</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(8%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>world united people nations states government country countries peace part</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
