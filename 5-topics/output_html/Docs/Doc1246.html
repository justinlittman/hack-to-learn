Her husband had been stationed overseas for a time but is now back in this country with her and their children. She had felt it would be wonderful to come home and be settled. After a short 18 months, however, her husband was transferred from his first post to the city of Washington.

Regular trips should be undertaken, with a qualified leader to explain all the sights. Efforts should be made to bring together children with the same tastes and interests, thereby helping them quickly to make new friends.
