                     Hyde ParkHYDE PARK, Wednesdayâ€”The two hours I spent at the N. Y. Herald Tribune Forum yesterday afternoon were most interesting, but I am troubled by the impression that people are thinking and talking today as though everything being done is in preparation for going to war. I suppose different people would explain the cause for this state of mind in different ways.
