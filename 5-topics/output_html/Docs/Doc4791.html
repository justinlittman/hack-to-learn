                     JOLIET, Ill..â€”Before I write anything else I want to pay a tribute, which I think is long overdue, to the New York City Police Department for the way in which it conducted itself in a most trying period last month when so many heads of state were in attendance at the United Nations General Assembly.
I know that many of them did not get their usual time off and that many of them worked a 12-hour day. Yet, by and large, I saw no one really discourteously treated and the policemen did their duty in guarding our foreign guests and in keeping our own tumultuous population in order with as little disturbance as possible.
Many of us plain citizens did suffer great inconvenience. The police kept cars and taxis moving and some of us who were accustomed to taking taxis in certain areas were unable to do so. And as citizens I don't think we were always as courteous and kind as we should have been, even realizing that we were suffering far less than the police.
So the least I can say now is that I appreciated what they did during this period of stress and that I commend both Police Commissioner Stephen Kennedy's organization and every individual policeman's sense of responsibility and the effort he made not to show the stress he was under.
I have been reading of the trouble suffered by some of the members of the New York City Police Department who were working on two jobs and the fear that these second jobs would interfere with their duties.
I am not in a position to investigate the rights and the wrongs of this situation, but one thing stands out clearly: New York City, which needs protection more than any other city, is not paying its policemen a living wage. This should not be.
I know all the city's difficulties about taxes and I am more conscious of the need for schools and better teachers' salaries than of anything else, but I think we who depend so much on the police should say a word in their favor. They are men with families even before they are policemen, and they want some of the things for their families that everybody else wants. If the way cannot be found whereby they can earn extra money, then it is clearly the duty of the citizens of New York to pay...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(44%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>people work children country public education school labor syndicate money</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(24%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>world united people nations states government country countries peace part</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(12%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>york mr united women young meeting group american feature city</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(12%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>people day men war things life great time today man</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(8%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>mrs morning house back yesterday afternoon time night miss washington</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
