                     HYDE PARK, Sunday
                  â€”We spent another session of Committee No. 3, last Friday, listening to the representatives of country after country make speeches in favor of the resolution proposed by Mrs. Begtrup of Denmark. The resolution asked that the General Assembly request members of the United Nations to grant political rights to women where they have not already done so.
This is in the Charter, of course, and the committee will unanimously pass the resolution, which it has been ready to do from the time of its introduction. Mrs. Pandit of India said she was not in favor of the resolution solely because she hoped the time would come when we could talk about human beings and not about men and women. I am quite sure, however, that India will vote to reaffirm what is already in the Charter.
Much to my amusement, Mrs. Pandit in her speech said that I felt women were not "ready for full political rights." I could not help wondering where she acquired this strange information, and I discovered afterward that it was from the ladies who back the Equal Rights amendment in this country. I was amused since these ladies know quite well that I am not opposed to equal political rights for women.
Our differences have always been on the question of whether in the U. S.U.S. we should pass a Constitutional amendment stating broadly that women shall be on an equal basis with men. This would necessitate ratification by two-thirds of the states, and would wipe out any protective legislation now in force for women. Since we would still have to repeal laws in the states which are unfair to women, it has always seemed to me less trouble to repeal these laws now by working in each state, and...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(54%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>world united people nations states government country countries peace part</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(20%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>york mr united women young meeting group american feature city</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(12%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>people work children country public education school labor syndicate money</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(8%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>mrs morning house back yesterday afternoon time night miss washington</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(7%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>people day men war things life great time today man</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
