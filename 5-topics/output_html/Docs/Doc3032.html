The first time I ever saw "Peter Pan" Maude Adams was the "child who wouldn't grow up." I thought her very charming, too, but the other night I thought Mary Martin and a spontaneous lightness and youthful quality about her that must be difficult to put on. And when anyone has it there is, of course, added beauty to this particular performance. Mr. Cyril Ritchard, who doubles as the father and the pirate, Captain Hook, gave an outstanding performance.
