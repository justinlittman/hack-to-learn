                     SEATTLE, Wash.SEATTLE, Fridayâ€”It was cloudy yesterday morning and we had a slight rain in the afternoon. Today the clouds are high and breaking up so I feel sure that I shall be able to start on my flight to Chicago this evening.
Most of the day yesterday was spent at home for both my daughter and I had work to do. She wrote her colum and I caught up on longhand letters, which are always one of the difficultues of my existence. I just do not get around to writing them. They languish in a compartment in my briefcase untill I know all my friends and relations think I have given myself over entirely to the typewriter and never put pen to paper any moreanymore.
In the afternoon we attended a Democratic gathering and visited a friend of Anna's, Mrs. Stanley Donogh, in the hospital, for a few minutes. She has had an attack of pleurisy and I can sympathize with her, for many years ago I had a very slight attack of this unpleasant ailment and found that it took many weeks before I really felt completely strong.
This is a curious campaign. It seems to engender a personal bitterness in many people, which hardly seems to me necessary for the wise consideration of such issues as are before the American people. For instance, this morning one letter came to me accusing me for a variety of reasons covering the last seven or eight years of being respionsibleresponsible for eggs which have been thrown at Mr. Willkie.
I take this opportunity of reiterating what has already been said by the President and many other people: I never have approved of egg-throwing nor of any kind of physical demonstration of disapproval in a campaign. It seems to me that the orderly working of the democratic process is injured when people resort to that kind of force.
