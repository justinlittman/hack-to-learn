                     Hyde Park, N. Y.HYDE PARK, Mondayâ€”Eleanor, young Curtis, and I drove home from the wedding on Saturday evening and arrived rather late, at least for them. When I telephoned over yesterday morning, Curtis asked to speak to me and told me his neck still felt very queer. I prophesied that it was the result of sleeping curled up in the car and, on inquiring today, found that the ill effects had pretty well worn off.
I was glad to find Mrs. Scheider really much better on Sunday morning, but the doctor is still keeping her in bed and she said that he gave her no encouragement this morning. His sole remark was to say rather haughtily that it was a strange thing that all his patients kept repeating, "When may I go home?"

He kept telling me that he had left home in the middle of the harvest, and any farmer knows that's a bad time to leave home, even for a brother's wedding.
My mother-in-law greets these large family influxes with great joy, but if I were in her place there are some things that I should find rather trying. For instance, having to dig out of everybody who will be home for lunch and who has invited any outside guests. I finally wrote a list out for her before leaving for the hospital to see Mrs. Scheider this morning, but I had a feeling that before I got back it might have changed several times.
