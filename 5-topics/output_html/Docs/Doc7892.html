                     WASHINGTON, Fridayâ€”Miss Thompson and I arrived in Washington in what seemed the depths of the night, but it was really a little after 7 A. M.a.m. yesterday. From then on it was a busy day.
At 11 o'clock the President and I received the staff of the executive offices to wish them all a merry Christmas, and at 12:30 Girl Scout Troop #167 came in and presented me with two big boxes of Christmas tree decorations.

The eldest little boy, eight years old, was full of initiative and had the nicest smile.
At 4 o'clock the President and I received all the house employees and their families in the East Room. The numbers have grown considerably because of the increase in the number of guards during the war, and, too, the families are larger, having been here a number of years. In all, 440 people came in to shake hands with the President and me yesterday afternoon. It is a great pleasure to see them all.
