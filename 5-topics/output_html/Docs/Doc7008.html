                     WASHINGTON, Monday—Ordinarily, today would be celebrated as a holiday everywhere throughout the country, but the necessities of the present time will make many of us think more seriously of George Washington and his contribution to the founding of this country than any holiday of previous years.

He believed in the ideals on which this nation was based and we must believe in them just as firmly to live through the present period triumphantly.

The meeting was in the schoolhouse, for they have there a real conception of community activity and work. Their Greenbelt Community Band gave a very good concert.
