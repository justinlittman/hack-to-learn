                     CHICAGO.â€”I must break into the coverage of my present trip for the American Association for the United Nations to tell you about what I think is an interesting and important series of panel discussions that are currently being held in New York. These meetings are part of the centennial season (1958-59) celebration of the Brooklyn Academy of Music, which is a division of the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences.
Mr. William Mckelvy Martin, the director of the Academy, has a strong conviction that human rights merit constant emphasis. So, back at the beginning of the season he arranged that one lecture be given, to be followed by a series of four panel discussions on this important issue.
He invited as his speaker Federal Judge J. Waties Waring, who handed up the public schools desegregation order in Clarendon, S.C., which led to the U.S. Supreme Court's decision barring segregation and ordering gradual integration in our public schools.
Judge Waring delivered that lecture last month, which was followed by the first of the panel discussions, the theme of which was "Discrimination in Sports." The guests on the panel were Jackie Robinson, Sugar Ray Robinson and Nat Ash, with Judge Waring acting as chairman and moderator, which will be his role at the three forthcoming meetings.
The second in the series will be held this Thursday, January 15, and the theme is "Discrimination in Education." Judge Waring's guests will include Dr. Kenneth Clark, noted psychologist and educator; Dr. Benjamin Fine, formerly education editor of The New York Times; and Dr. Gardner C. Taylor, the head of the Concord Baptist Church and the only Negro member of the New York City Board of Education and also the head of the Protestant Council of New York.
On February 5 "Discrimination in the Entertainment Field" will be the subject, with the guests still to be chosen.
Then on March 12 Judge Waring will bring to his panel discussion U.S. Senator Jacob Javits and Norman Thomas, and they will discuss the position of the Negro and other minorities in the national and international fields.
These discussions should be a great help in stimulating the people of our great City of New York to accept their responsibilities on one of the questions that concerns vast areas of the world today. Our country's position in the world today is very much affected by our attitude toward minorities at home. In the great struggle between the Communist and the non-Communist nations in their appeal to the noncommitted areas of the world, the question of the equality granted by us to the minor...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(32%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>world united people nations states government country countries peace part</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(29%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>york mr united women young meeting group american feature city</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(21%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>people work children country public education school labor syndicate money</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(11%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>people day men war things life great time today man</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(7%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>mrs morning house back yesterday afternoon time night miss washington</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
