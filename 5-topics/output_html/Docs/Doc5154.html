I spoke for a few minutes this afternoon at the annual convention of the Women's League of the United Synagogues of America. Later in the afternoon we had a musical at which the Nightingale Trio composed of Miss Louise Sandor, Miss Ivonne Ravel and Miss Nelilu Winger sang delightfully and looked as attractive as they sounded. Mr. Joseph Schuster, violoncellist, played beautifully and Mr. Peter Joray appeared in clever and amusing monologues written by Paul Horgon.
Tonight I attend the Business and Professional Women's Dinner, which will open National Business Women's Week throughout the country.
