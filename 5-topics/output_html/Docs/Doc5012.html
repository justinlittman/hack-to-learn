                     NEW YORK.—I was much interested to read that the National Park Service will shortly be authorized to take over and administer two shrines in New York State—one, the birthplace of President Theodore Roosevelt on East 20th Street in New York City; and the other, Sagamore Hill on Long Island, which was built in 1884 and served as the summer White House during Theodore Roosevelt's Presidency.
Sagamore Hill, which President Roosevelt built and lived in for years, is well known and a good many people are attracted to visit this house which is so full of reminders of one of our most colorful Presidents.
I have always regretted, however, that more people did not know of the two houses on East 20th Street, which belonged to Theodore Roosevelt Sr., father of President Theodore Roosevelt, and his brother, James Roosevelt. It was in the senior Theodore Roosevelt's home on East 20th Street that this most interesting family lived and where most of the children were brought up. The home itself is very typical of the way of life of a comfortable merchant in the New York City of that day.
Later the two brothers built houses on 57th Street when that location was looked upon as really out in the country. And I remember a distant cousin and friend of the family who lived on Washington Square, Mrs. Weeks, who said, when her son Frederick told her he was going to a housewarming party in those 57th Street houses, that she hoped he was spending the night!
In my young days I always felt that Mrs. Weeks was our tie to the past, because she loved to tell the younger members of the family how in her youth she had danced with General Lafayette at a ball given for him in New York when he came back for a visit long after the Revolutionary War.
The Theodore Roosevelt house on East 20th Street is so easy to visit, and the James Roosevelt house next door has many things arranged in museum fashion of interest to young people.
If it is possible to make history live for our younger generation, I think visiting the houses where people they read about really lived is one of the best ways to create a vivid concept of the past.
Someone spoke to me the other day about the lack of comprehension so many young people have of even fairly recent history, and I think one of the reasons for this is because we do not often try to do the things that would make what they read seem closer and more dramatic than the events can possibly seem in the mere cold type of a book.
For instance, many of our young people have the opportunity to travel to Europe. Yet, I think very few of us ever think to suggest that on these travels—whether in Italy or France—they should visit the cemeteries where thousands of Americans who fell in World War I and World War II are buried. A number of the cemeteries are now supervised by American war veterans. I feel it is important that we do this when we can, or the upkeep of the cemeteries will seem of less importance to those w...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(31%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>world united people nations states government country countries peace part</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(29%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>people day men war things life great time today man</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(17%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>mrs morning house back yesterday afternoon time night miss washington</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(13%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>york mr united women young meeting group american feature city</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(9%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>people work children country public education school labor syndicate money</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
