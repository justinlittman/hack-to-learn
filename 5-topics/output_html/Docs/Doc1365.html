                     HYDE PARK, Friday
                  â€”Yesterday I left Hyde Park in the morning and then took an afternoon train to Saybrook, Connecticut, in order to speak in the evening to the League of Women Voters at Clinton.
It seemed to me as I travelled along the seashore that the first signs of autumn were visible and I cannot say that I like the idea of summer drawing to a close.
On Wednesday at Hyde Park we had a violent thunder storm and in the middle of the storm hail stones fell.

My son, Elliott, took his older children into the city Wednesday and he and Elliott, juniorJunior, went to see "Mr. Roberts," which I know they both enjoyed.

The members of the House of Representatives seem to be slipping away so fast that they have decided to adjourn until September 21st and leave the Senate at work. It is a little hard on the Senatorssenators, I think, because I imagine the average age in the Senate is higher than that of the members of the House and they must feel the pull of the long, hot summer even more keenly than the Representatives.
The other day I read a criticism of some of the members of the House for missing certain roll calls, but judging from the attitude of members of Congress, when I have been in the gallery, I think there must be a good many of them who are hardly aware when a roll call is being taken. It makes a curious impression upon one to sit in the gallery and watch the rather uninterested way in which members come and go during a speech.
