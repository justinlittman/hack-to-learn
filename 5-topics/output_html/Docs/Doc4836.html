                  —The attitude of the Soviet Union toward United Nations Secretary General Dag Hammarskjold seems to me an extraordinary position for the Soviets to take. What good do they hope to achieve by refusing to recognize Mr. Hammarskjold? It is his duty to carry out the decisions made in the U.N. Just because the Soviets have opposed some of these decisions is no reason, it seems to me, for blaming him. He has merely reflected the majority action in the U.N. itself.

The members of Congress who think only along partisan lines and who still believe in the old idea that somehow, given time, economic conditions will right themselves should give this problem serious thought. If they tend toward letting it solve itself the people are going to be aroused as they were in 1932. I think that is what President Kennedy is going to have to face up to if Congress will not listen when he tells them how serious our...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(46%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>world united people nations states government country countries peace part</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(31%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>people work children country public education school labor syndicate money</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(12%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>people day men war things life great time today man</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(7%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>york mr united women young meeting group american feature city</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
