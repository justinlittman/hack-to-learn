                  â€”Sometimes I wish I had a greater knowledge of finance, of military situations and of the actual reasons motivating the members of Congress in some of the things they do!
It would then be much simpler to know why certain actions are taken. For instance, why was it essential for Congress to order a certain sum of money loaned to the Spanish government when other business loans are being made through the usual business channels of the Export Import Bank or the World Bank? That would seem the normal routine way to handle a business transaction.
The course that Congress has followed makes me wonder what the hidden reason is for their action. Like everybody else in the country, I have heard it said that it is essential for us to have certain bases in Spain, but undoubtedly these bases are to be leased, and we will pay for them. In no newspaper could I find any reference to this agreement having been made with the Spanish government, and I wonder if it really is so necessary to establish bases in Spain.
We are told many things these days, but on this point the people in authority have been rather quiet. Yet the implications are such that, in a democracy, if this is one of the objectives of the loan, we should know something about it.
Spain is still a dictatorship. It is a country where religion and government are very closely allied. This relationship is one that greatly concerns the Spanish people, and no outside government or individual has any right to interfere with what goes on within the Spanish state. If the Spanish people or government desire a loan however, it should be considered by the usual group on a financial basis, and I do not understand the need for the legislative branch of our government to be so so...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(48%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>world united people nations states government country countries peace part</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(36%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>people work children country public education school labor syndicate money</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(10%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>people day men war things life great time today man</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(6%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>mrs morning house back yesterday afternoon time night miss washington</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
