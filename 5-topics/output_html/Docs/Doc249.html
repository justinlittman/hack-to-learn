"Dear Mademoiselle:—I received safely your package for my little boy and don't know how to thank you, for he had nothing left, seeing my husband was a political deportee just back and not well yet...Dear Mademoiselle, if you could be near us to offer you a few flowers because I am happy for my little boy.
