                     New YorkNEW YORK, Mondayâ€”While on the subject of rumor and gossip, I would like to mention one persistent rumor which has come to me in many different forms ever since early last summer. It has absolutely no foundation in fact.
The first I heard of it was when I received several letters saying that certain marines were writing home from the Pacific that they had heard that I advocated six months' quarantine for them after the war, because they would not be fit to associate with the "workers" at home.
In a later version, the marines were changed to army men who had been out in the Pacific. When I went down to the Caribbean, last winter, I met this same story everywhere. Instead of being about the men in the Pacific, however, it was about men in the Caribbean. Now, lo and behold!behold, it turns up in my mail again, this time about paratroopers in the European area.
