                     Seattle, Wash.SEATTLE, Wednesday—I have very little information to give you today, because when one spends most of one's time in a hospital not a great many things happen.

The child looked as though she had quite a high fever, and told me she was threatened with pneumonia. However, she seemed to be fairly strong, and I hope with all the modern treatments we have discovered for this disease, that she will come through it all right.
