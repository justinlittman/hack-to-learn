                     DE KALB, Ill..â€”I spent last Sunday in Boston working on the education television program, "Prospects of Mankind," which will be shown at later dates in various parts of the country. The program, which will have its second showing next Sunday, is produced by Station WGBH, the educational TV station in Boston in cooperation with Brandeis University.
The subject for the second show is disarmament, and those appearing on the panel are Mr. Jules Moch of France; Mr. Trevor Gardener, who was Assistant Secretary for Air and now serves on the President's Science Advisory Committee even though he has returned to industry and is engaged in making missiles; and Mr. Saville Davis, managing editor of the Christian Science Monitor.

I took my second class at Brandeis University on Monday morning with Professor Fuchs, who is certainly a most-stimulating person to be with, and the young people seem to be interested and to be doing a great deal of thinking. The hour-and-a-half discussion session flies past very quickly, and I think I learn much more than I could ever teach.

This is hog and corn land, but there is a good sprinkling of Black Angus cattle to be seen, and there must be some dairy farming. The barns are really magnificent and in most cases the houses really look spacious and comfortable. I was told that farming had become big business in this area, so that much machinery is used, and when I inquired if this machinery was pooled and used cooperatively I learned that this was a necessity for many.
Northern Illinois University is an all-purpose school. It gives a liberal arts course, but also trains teachers, has a big department for business administration and a number of other schools. Nearly all the students come from within 100 miles, except, of course, for the foreign students, of which there are two or three dozen who come from every area of the world. There is no racial or religious discrimination, either in the faculty or in the student body, and because there is a mixed po...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(31%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>york city school group education national state meeting young dr</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(17%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic6.html>mrs morning afternoon mr washington evening time night miss yesterday</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(14%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic7.html>mr american people time interesting good york find united made</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(11%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic10.html>house beautiful back morning told looked good park drive day</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(9%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>people country labor government money conditions public business areas make</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(7%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>children work women young men boys home service care training</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
