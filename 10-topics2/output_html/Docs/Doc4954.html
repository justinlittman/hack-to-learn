                     HYDE PARK.—Everyone will join in sympathy for Gov. and Mrs. Nelson Rockefeller in their anxiety over their youngest son. By the time this column is published I hope the Governor's trip with his daughter will be rewarded by a reunion with his son. It is a most anxious trip and all one can do is pray that this young life with so much promise may be saved.
I have a letter from an Englishwoman, whom I do not know, but I shall copy here a portion of it because her point of view is one shared by many Europeans and one to which we in this country should give some attention.
She starts by speaking of her relatives here, the beauty of our country, the people she has known and liked, and then she writes:
"But, oh, the dreadful publicity that your country gets abroad. The BBC interviews with the folk who are all in favor of war, the elaborate fallout shelters with guns to defend them against fellow Americans, the `survival' film company! All these we hear about and it really seems as though America is set on a war and that so long as she has enough shelters and can look after her own the rest of us can go hang.
"As our government has said, it would dislocate our economy too much to provide such shelters here, and so how can the governments of the poor, backward lands, who cannot even get enough to eat, hope to shelter their people from fallout?
"Believe me, Mrs. Roosevelt, that is how things look to other nations and that is why, horrified as we all are by Russian tests, we can nevertheless see something of their point of view. They have no shelters either, so can it be they who are seeking a war ..... . . .

There is a feeling that we are so rich that we think we can provide ourselves with shelters even in a nuclear war. Of course, most of us know quite well that if a nuclear war comes shelters—even if our government works out a feasible program—would save comparatively few lives. And whether survivors would find the world still worth living in is a question none of us can answer.
We, unfortunately, have the responsibility of being the chief negotiators with Mr. Khrushchev. For some strange reason the world—not only of Europe but of Asia and Africa—seems to be less afraid of the Soviet threat in spite of all the evidence that the Russians actually prepare for war and threaten it more than we do. We only respond to their threats. On the other hand, however, because of our power in the past we do have installations all over the world which are designed to be pure...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(25%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>government president soviet union people party democratic situation state communist</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(19%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>people war great time country things feel today men make</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(12%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic7.html>mr american people time interesting good york find united made</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(10%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>united world nations states part reproduction prohibited countries general rights</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(9%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>day life hyde park years people world man book things</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(8%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic6.html>mrs morning afternoon mr washington evening time night miss yesterday</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(6%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>people country labor government money conditions public business areas make</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
