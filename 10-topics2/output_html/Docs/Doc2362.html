                     SANTIAGO, CHILESANTIAGO, Chile, Wednesday
                  —The ceremonies for which we had all come to Santiago—the inauguration of the new President—were all very interesting to me, especially in comparison to the way in which we inaugurate our President in the United States.
This was a significant election here—hard fought but in which not one of the candidates received a majority of votes. So, according to the Chilean constitution, the choice between the two top men had to be made by the Congress and Senor Carlos Ibanez del Campo was named.

All the gentlemen attending the ceremonies had to be either in dress uniform with all their decorations or in evening clothes and high hats, and I suspected that some of our delegation, who are not hardened diplomats, felt a little uncomfortable in their "white ties and tails" in the brilliant sunshine.
