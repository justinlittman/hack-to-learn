                     NEW YORK.—A couple of weeks ago there was a very significant story in the newspapers about the crew of the submarine Seawolf and how they used their leisure time when their ship was submerged for a couple of months and cut off from the rest of the world.
For them, of course, this was a very particular and peculiar situation. But as was pointed out in the article this question of leisure time is one that is going to affect thousands of persons, perhaps our industrial workers more than anyone else, because as automation goes on we are going to produce more machine-made things in less and less time.

Already many industrial workers perform one particular bit of a task over and over again and never get the satisfaction of producing something that can be seen growing from start to finish. The old-fashioned craftsman had the joy of creation. The new industrial worker has little or none of that satisfaction, so he must find it elsewhere.
