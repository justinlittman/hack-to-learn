                     WASHINGTON, Fridayâ€”Last night, in New York City, I went to a movie, which I enjoyed very much, and then took the night train back here. This morning I have attended a final staff conference with Dean James Landis, and held my own final staff conference. It is certainly a grand feeling to work with people and, when you leave, to feel a real warmth of feeling and a sense of regret on their part as well as your own.
I am going back for a conference with Mr. Paul Kellogg of our Advisory Committee this afternoon, and shall then leave my desk in the Office of Civilian Defense for good.

I am including in this party tonight, the members of my own office staff at the White House.

Eat it up.
Wear it out.
Make it do.
Do without.
Four little sayings, but if we take them really to heart, what a difference they may make in our daily contribution to the winning of the war.
I have just received a request to mention to you that Saturday, February 21st, has been designated as "Norway-Day" by Mrs. J. Borden Harriman, who is chairman of the "American Friends of Norway," 36 East 48th Street, New York City. On this day they are making a special appeal to those who ski, asking that they give what they can to provide medical supplies for ski battalions of Norwegian expeditionary forces, now training in Iceland and Canada.
