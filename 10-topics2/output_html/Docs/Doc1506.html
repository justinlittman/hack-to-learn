I would not mind half so much losing a part of this money if the food actually nourished someone in the world who needed it. It seems to me that these fields, which have borne so many potatoes, might perhaps under proper guidance have produced something even more useful to us or to someone else in the world. Potatoes are bulky and not easy to ship abroad, though I understand if they are dehydrated at once it is possible to ship them more economically.
I cannot help feeling, however, that this whole question bears studying and that we need a food and agriculture commission of our own.

Once they have been bought by the government we should resell them or exchange them for other goods that we do need.
