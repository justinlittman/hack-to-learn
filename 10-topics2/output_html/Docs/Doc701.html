                     HYDE PARK, Friday
                  —I had another picnic yesterday, for a second group of little boys from Wiltwyck School with their counsellors and Dr. Cooper, who always brings them and is so wise in directing them.
As I watched them, I kept thinking of a book which I have been looking through, "Unto the Least of These" by Emma Octavia Lundberg.

One little boy looked up at me yesterday and said, "I have been here three times. I remember when you read to us about Tiny Tim. Are you going to finish about him today?" He had an almost possessive attitude—offered to run errands and carry around plates of food.
