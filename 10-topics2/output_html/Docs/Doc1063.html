If I find I cannot get everything done before I start, Miss Thompson says the chances are that the trip to Europe will be smooth, so we can wind up the last details on board. I am not quite as optimistic as she is because, while I think the trip may be smooth, I am conscious of the fact that there will be much for me to learn.
