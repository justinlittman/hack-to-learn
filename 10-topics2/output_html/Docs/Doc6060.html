One group has gathered and sent out to its community organizations the following suggestions: (1) write to, or interview, the editor of your local newspaper and ask him for a daily column: "The Things We Take For Granted",," i.e. our democratic way of life. (2) Write to, or interview the leaders of public thought in your community and ask them to speak and preach about the joys and privileges of democracy and religious tolerance.
