These people are receiving workmen's compensation and are under medical care for injuries received. In many cases they have had a rather difficult time, not only with their injuries but in getting their claims for compensation recognized. And, of course, they are naturally worried should anything occur that would make them uncertain as to what would happen to them in the future.
It is important, however, in the medical picture, that there should be more knowledge given directly by the beneficiaries in order that they themselves may be helped in various ways.
The study is being financed by the U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare, Office of Rehabilitation, headed by Miss Mary Sweitzer, and it will extend over a three-year period ending in 1962.
Other studies that have been made show that many employers do not care to hire disabled job applicants—even if it can be demonstrated that these applicants can perform adequately the work required.
Therefore, the ultimate aim of the present study is to get employers to employ people who have been handicapped. It is hoped that there will be an increase in the hiring of the disabled, rather than putting them on relief.
The people conducting the study need case histories from impaired workers who would tell of their employment and job experiences subsequent to their recovery and re-entry into the labor market. For this purpose the study group is interviewing nearly 2,000 men in the New York metropolitan area who have received serious and permanent injuries while on the job. Most of these people were injured approximately five years ago, and in the questionnaire being sent to them there are questions con...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(31%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>people country labor government money conditions public business areas make</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(17%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>children work women young men boys home service care training</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(15%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>york city school group education national state meeting young dr</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(12%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>people war great time country things feel today men make</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(9%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>united world nations states part reproduction prohibited countries general rights</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(8%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic7.html>mr american people time interesting good york find united made</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
