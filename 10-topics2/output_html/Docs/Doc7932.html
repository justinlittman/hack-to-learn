                     NEW YORK, Wednesday—Mrs. Henry Morgenthau Jr., Miss Thompson and I went last night to see one of the most delightful plays in New York—"The Hasty Heart," by John Patrick. There is only one stage setting: the convalescent ward of a British general hospital in the rear of the Assam-Burma front.
The cast is all-male except for "Sister Margaret," who was certainly a lovely Sister, even though one might expect the eyes of wounded men far away from home to look upon any woman with pleasure! There is all the tragedy of life and war in this play, but also all the humor that youth creates and that probably keeps our soldiers going on all the fronts in the world.
I will not tell you the story, but you will find your heart lifted by the sheer goodness and kindness of human beings. That's what saved the dour young Scot, and that after all is the only thing that makes living and struggling in this rather tragic world an exciting adventure.
