The victims are in large part children and so far no cure is known, so the funds raised will be devoted to helping this research.
The mail carriers will deliver a few days before Thanksgiving 25,000,000 contribution envelopes throughout the country. After Thanksgiving Day 100,000 letter carriers will re-walk their routes to collect contributions from every American home.
On the evening before Thanksgiving there will be a four-hour coast to coast radio and television program, featuring famous Hollywood and Broadway personalities.
