                     HYDE PARK, Thursday
                  —One is distressed to read in the press that one of our most cool-headed Senators—Sen. Paul Douglas of Illinois—apparently had a temporary breakdown. He screamed and walked off the Senate floor in tears.
One can only say that it must take remarkable self-control not to do this very frequently if one has the slightest interest in what actually is happening to the country, and the reaction to it in the Senate of the United States. I have had people tell me they can't even read what goes on from day to day because it upsets them too much. What it must be to have to sit in the Senate and listen day after day is hard to imagine.
Sometimes when I pick up the Congressional Record (which I used to recommend for reading at bedtime to induce sleep) I shudder and hope that all I read is not true. One cannot go to sleep anymore, however, over the record because it produces just the opposite effect. It raises one's blood pressure and one can't sleep at all.
The truth is that all of us are going through a very difficult period. One of the reasons children stand their early years so well is because of their youthful stamina and education does not upset them as much as it does the rest of us. Education to the rest of us is a painful process and we suddenly find that those of us who thought our years of education, at least of formal education, were over, have to begin again and learn new things.
Since we are a democracy our representatives in Congress reflect our degree of education, and I think perhaps that is what made Senator Douglas scream. Many of the things he has been fighting for will probably be done if we, the people, and our representatives are good enough and sufficiently well educated to do them in the way the Senator believes they should be done. Much of the money that he thinks is wasted—if it is wasted—is wasted because most of us do not know what our jobs are all...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(22%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>people war great time country things feel today men make</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(16%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>day life hyde park years people world man book things</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(16%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>government president soviet union people party democratic situation state communist</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(15%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>united world nations states part reproduction prohibited countries general rights</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(7%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic10.html>house beautiful back morning told looked good park drive day</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(7%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>people country labor government money conditions public business areas make</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(6%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic7.html>mr american people time interesting good york find united made</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(5%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>york city school group education national state meeting young dr</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
