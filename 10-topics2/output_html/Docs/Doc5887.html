                     Hyde Park, N. Y.HYDE PARK, Wednesday —Of course, just as I moved all my tables for supper to the porch, last night, the weather cleared nicely. But I did not move out under the trees again.
The guests began to arrive at 4 o'clock and it was pleasant indeed to sit out by the swimming pool, while some went in for a dip. Then we had supper, afterwards clearing the rooms for dancing and singing. We ended just before midnight with the Virginia reel, which left everyone hot and breathless, but in fine mood to go home.
The lovely purple loose-strife, which grows in marshy ground, is just beginning to come out. It makes the marsh adjoining our little ponds a blaze of color, reflected in the water. I remember it all through the year as one of the most brilliant of nature's shows.

This is easier to do indoors, for though I hesitate even to suggest such a thing—most of my neighbors will not acknowledge it—honesty compels me to say there are mosquitoes about us and their humming and their bites are distracting to orderly meetings.
In the midst of the party yesterday afternoon, I was told that the Philadelphia operator wished to speak to me. In a few minutes Franklin, Jr., came on the wire to announce that his wife, Ethel, and a new baby boy were both doing well. I had not expected to hear quite so soon. It certainly is very pleasant to know that the two principals in this happy event are getting along so well.
