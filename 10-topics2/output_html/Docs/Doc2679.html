                     NEW YORK, Thursday
                  â€”I have just been notified that a charity which I thought had come to an end a long while ago is asking for help again. It is called "New Eyes for the Needy, Inc.",," and operates in Short Hills, N.J. What they ask is that you do not throw away old spectacles or bits of old gold scrap but send them to their organization instead.
During the past year they have donated 1,100 pairs of new prescription eye glasses for the needy in 45 states. Four thousand pairs of glasses were sent to recognized welfare agencies and clinics to be redistributed. Through CARE's Assistance they sent over 2,000 pairs of eye glasses and 500 artificial eyes to Dr. Rambo, a missionary eye surgeon in India.
That is really quite a record of service and they are completely dependent on the public which knows about the organization and sends them old specs and bits of old gold. This work is sponsored by the Short Hills Junior Chamber Service League. Whatever money the organization has is derived solely from the sale of contributed precious metal.
