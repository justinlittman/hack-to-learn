                  —It seems to me that I have never received so much literature on the subject of conservation as I have this year. The National Forest Recreation SocietyAssociation has just sent me a pamphlet, and in this pamphlet they point out that, because of lack of appropriations to our Forest Service, we the people are in danger of losing the recreational facilities that are used by so many of us.
Many of these camp sites are no longer clean and sanitary, and therefore not safe places to camp. Congress has neglected to give sufficient money for the purpose of increasing camping-ground areas and making in the forests small recreational areas for picnickers. This means that the outdoor recreation which so many people could have at low cost is not as widely available as it should be.
