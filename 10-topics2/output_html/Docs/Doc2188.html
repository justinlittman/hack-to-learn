                  â€”It is most depressing day after day to read in the papers of the loss caused by floods in the Mississippi and Missouri river areas. This has been happening year after year, and I can remember how the National Resources Board and my husband tried to make plans that would eventually mean not only control of these waters but the use of these waters for the benefit of the people of these areas.
