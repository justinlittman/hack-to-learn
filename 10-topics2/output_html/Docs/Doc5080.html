                  .â€”Not long ago I received a letter from a middle-aged couple who, for reasons of health, had to move to a warmer climate. They chose a Southwestern state and, on the basis of advertisements they had read in the newspapers, bought a piece of land in the expectation that they would be able to raise food on it.
When they arrived at their newly-purchased site, they found that they were surrounded by desert. Perhaps some daysomeday, when water was brought in, this desert would bloom.

The danger exemplified by the plight of this couple has troubled me a good deal. Some of the Southwestern states have tried to set up safeguards against these wildcat advertisements, but prospective purchasers are generally unaware that they exist or can be consulted. I feel that perhaps our newspapers have an obligation to check such advertisements and to publish the sources from which information regarding the land can be obtained.
Failure to carry out one's responsibilities properly is not limited, however, to any single class or locality.
