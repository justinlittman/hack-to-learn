                     NEW YORK.â€”I liked President Kennedy's answer given on Wednesday to the two neutralist leaders from the Belgrade meetings and I was particularly interested in his statement that the presence of our Secretary of State Dean Rusk and of Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko at the United Nations General Assembly next week would "provide an opportunity for serious talks about Germany and other problems if the Soviet side proves willing."
The General Assembly convenes next Tuesday, and it is evident that the President has decided to be quite sure that before there are any summit talks that other avenues shall have proved the possibility of making a summit talk serve a useful purpose.

As the Russians continue their nuclear blasts from day to day one cannot help feeling that this is done to force upon the people of the world the recognition of the pursuit of scientific knowledge and of the power wielded by the Soviet Union. From our Western cowboy days we have many stories of the things people did under the threat of a gun held to their ribs. Sometimes the purposes were good, but more often they were bad.
In the present effort by the Soviet Union to give the peoples of the world a taste of the old type of lynch law, which in civilized countries has been out of favor for a long time, the Soviets are going backward in what we suppose is an effort to produce panic, particularly in the U.S. Something one is very familiar with, however, never creates panic. When one has outgrown such threats, these threats may create contempt or may create amusement, but never panic.
