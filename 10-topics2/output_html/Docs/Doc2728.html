                     HYDE PARK, Friday
                  —I received a letter the other day which was for me rather a shock. It quoted some of the clauses in the constitutions of some Greek letter college fraternities or sororities. Here is one example: members "must be of the Aryan race and not of the black, Malayan or Semitic race." I can't help wondering why they picked out Malayan particularly. It seems to me that they might have found something more all-encompassing than Malaya. Another clause includes the Mongolian race.
As I read this communication I could not help laughing. It all seemed so utterly ridiculous. In a world which is growing so interdependent, how is it possible for people to think about each other in little compartments? Heaven knows, we don't like all of the members of our own race, but we do find a few that we get along with very well.
Possibly if we had a chance of association with some people of these other races mentioned we might, while disliking some of them, like others. I have always felt that this curious way of labelling whole groups of people as unacceptable was an impossible thing to go on within a world where you are constantly meeting large groups of these "unacceptables," perhaps even having to go and live among them for business or professional reasons.
But to get back to our own fraternities, we have in the United States people who descend from many different races. Most of us can count at least five or six different strains of blood in our veins. I have French, Scotch, English, Irish and Dutch—that I know about!
There are many other people who are good Americans today who have come from many other parts of the world and it is impossible to say that you will accept this person but you will not accept the other, purely on the basis of some racial strain. Of course, I know that there are also situations in this country where there is discrimination on religious grounds but that, too, seems to me very un-American and probably is as out of place in the world of today as discrimination for racial reaso...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(28%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>york city school group education national state meeting young dr</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(20%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>united world nations states part reproduction prohibited countries general rights</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(11%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>government president soviet union people party democratic situation state communist</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(11%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>people war great time country things feel today men make</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(10%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic7.html>mr american people time interesting good york find united made</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(6%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>day life hyde park years people world man book things</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(5%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>people country labor government money conditions public business areas make</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
