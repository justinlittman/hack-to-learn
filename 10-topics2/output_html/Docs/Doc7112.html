                     New YorkNEW YORK, Wednesdayâ€”It was a great pleasure yesterday afternoon to have an opportunity to see Senora unremarkablede Calderon Guardia, the wife of the President of Costa Rica. She came here because of ill health, but after spending some time in Baltimore, Md., under the care of doctors, looks as well as when I last saw her.
