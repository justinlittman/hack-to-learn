                     New YorkNEW YORK.—I was sent a reprint from The Wall Street Journal the other day on the episode about the Hope Indians, and I think it is who worthy of being told to as many people as possible.
It appears that "six Hopi Indians, having consulted their gods and their prophecies, traveled to New York City to instruct the delegates to the United Nations on what the Hopis fear will come to pass as soon as the corn is harvested.
"The reason for their long trip was that an ancient prophecy adjured the religious leaders of the Hopis to go, at a certain time, to the 'house of glass walls to inform the nations of the day of purification.' And that certain time is ripening, as corn does in the Arizona sun."
It seems there was nobody at the U.N. to receive the six Hopi Indians and their message. There were sessions going on, of course, of different units. But in the complicated machinery of the U.N. you must present your desire to be heard according to protocol, and one could hardly expect that the Hopi Indians would understand this particular type of protocol.
The man at the desk who dealt with them must have had very little imagination and no flair for a good newspaper story.
The U.N. was established to bring about the peace of the world and when people come—even Indians with a religious warning on peace, or rather on the troubles that may come if we do not have peace—they certainly should be heard in high places.
I am sure, had they known of the visit, either Mr. Andrew Cordier or Dr. Ralph Bunche would have been glad to sit down and listen to the prophecies that started six Hopi Indians on that long trip from Arizona to the U.N.
They want peace primarily between their own tribes or between their tribes and the U.S., but their message might well be of value to all the "tribes" of the world as they meet trying to find solutions to different questions that bedevil the world today.
Peace is the preoccupation of people everywhere in the world. Their leaders may weigh the question of whether modified wars might serve their purposes. None of them, however, actually dares to suggest that nuclear war is something to be hoped for. And it is quite possible that Premier Nikita Khrushchev, with his firm determination that the world must be a Communist world, still feels that he can accomplish this—a little more slowly perhaps, but even better—through other methods than wa...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(28%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>united world nations states part reproduction prohibited countries general rights</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(16%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>day life hyde park years people world man book things</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(15%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>government president soviet union people party democratic situation state communist</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(13%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>people war great time country things feel today men make</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(8%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic10.html>house beautiful back morning told looked good park drive day</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(7%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic7.html>mr american people time interesting good york find united made</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
