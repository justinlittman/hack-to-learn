                     WASHINGTON, Sunday
                  .—This is New Year's Eve. In a press conference some time ago, I was asked what was my wish for this New Year's Day and, like every other person in this country and in many other countries in the world, I said: "That the war may end soon."
None of us will be thinking of anything else, but perhaps we can think primarily of how we can do our part better in helping the war effort—perhaps by not complaining if things seem to us a little trying at times, and we do not quite see the reason why certain things are as they are; perhaps by working a little harder at whatever our jobs may be; perhaps by thinking a little more of the men who have already done their service in the war and are coming back into civilian life.
