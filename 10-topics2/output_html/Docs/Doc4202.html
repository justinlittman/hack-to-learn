                     NEW YORK.â€”We are celebrating this month the 100th anniversary of Theodore Roosevelt's birth. No one in public life ever had any meaning to me before I became old enough to be conscious of this uncle of mine as a public character.
I grew up in my grandmother's house where politics was almost never mentioned and it was only when I began to read the newspapers myself that I became conscious of the first cartoons of Theodore Roosevelt as New York City police commissioner with very prominent front teeth!

His friends were often put to these physical tests as well.
