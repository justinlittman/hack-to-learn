                  â€”Recently I saw a letter from a minister to the Secretary of Agriculture which pointed out that the Bible contained some suggestions that might be of value in solving the question of surplus farm production. It referred to the passage in Leviticus which says: "Six years shall you plough your fields and collect its crops . . . and on the seventh year, you shall declare a rest for the soil."
The implication here is that one-seventh of our farm land be given a rest every year. The farmers would be compensated for allowing this area to lie fallow, and the result would be a better crop the following year.
I believe this, of course, has been one of the principles of good farming for a long time. The farmer rotates his crops in nearly all his fields, and from time to time plows certain crops under to enrich the soil. Certainly the idea of producing crops that come from better soil is nothing new to those who have been discussing organic farming.
The second idea proposed is that a food bank should be set up. This seems to me more questionable in its practical aspects, because no matter how carefully you try to keep things in storage there will be some deterioration after a certain period.
I believe this question should be studied in cooperation with Food and Agriculture, a specialized agency of the United Nations. This agency has made a careful study of world conditions and could probably keep us informed as to the areas where exchanges of goods could profitably take place, where there is need for certain kinds of food which are surplus in other areas, and which could be sold without upsetting the economy of other nations selling the same product to certain special areas i...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(36%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>people country labor government money conditions public business areas make</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(21%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>united world nations states part reproduction prohibited countries general rights</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(15%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>government president soviet union people party democratic situation state communist</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(7%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>children work women young men boys home service care training</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(6%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic7.html>mr american people time interesting good york find united made</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(6%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>people war great time country things feel today men make</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
