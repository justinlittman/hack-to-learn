                     MONTEREY, Calif.
                  â€”As is usual, the other day in Los Angeles a press conference at 11:30 in the morning meant a terrific amount of paraphernalia for TV and radio reporters and photographers, and even two youngsters from a high-school newspaper, cluttering up Mrs. Hershey Martin's living room. By lunchtime, however, all their belongings were back on the little trucks they trundle around and the house looked like a home again.
