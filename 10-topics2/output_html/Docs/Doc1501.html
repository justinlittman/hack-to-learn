                     CHAPEL HILL, NORTH CAROLINACHAPEL HILL, N.C., Wednesday.—Our bad luck on train schedules followed us on last Friday night and our train from the West came in after 2 A.M.a.m. instead of at midnight.

I have been asked several times in press conferences how I feel about the passage by the Senate of the Equal Rights Amendment.
I think I feel somewhat the way our Democratic Senator Lehman from New York State feels. I regret to see wiped out legislation which has proved of benefit to women. I realize that for women engaged in industry there may be today wider labor organization, but even then it seems to me that the passage of this amendment will mean a great deal of energy put into ratification by the necessary number of states.
