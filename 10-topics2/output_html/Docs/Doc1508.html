                     NEW YORK, Thursday
                  â€”Wednesday morning dawned clear and cold, but everyone was shivering because our changes of temperature this winter have been so sudden. However, I was delighted to be able to fly to Boston instead of taking an early morning train.

Harvard Hall, in which the dinner sponsored by the Harvard Club of Boston was held, is really a very beautiful room. It was filled to capacity, and Walter H. Trumbull, chairman of the dinner, told me they had had to disappoint a great many who wanted tickets.
