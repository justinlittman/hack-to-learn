                     PARIS, Thursday.â€”I have had two late afternoon receptions this week for the members of Committee 3 and I hope to have two more today and tomorrow. In this way the members of the staff who are working with me and I will have an opportunity to meet and talk with the members of other delegations on Committee 3 who are going to work and serve with us.
There are more women on Committee 3 than ever before, and some of the men have already told me that they are going to feel discriminated against because of the preponderence of females. There are even some women on the Political Committee this year.
One of our male advisers and a Polish representative, who is adviser to the Polish delegate on Committee 3, met here with considerable amusement.

And while the U.S. Senate is willing to make a contribution to this work, the House of Representatives has steadily refused to do so. The other governments have stepped up their contributions to something like six million dollars, but there is a general feeling that our government, through our Congress, should now make some concessions.
It is difficult to explain to the governments interested in the Children's Emergency Fund exactly why our House does not yet quite understand the position of this organization, and I am not at all sure that by and large in the country the position of the House is not upheld.
It seems to many people very appealing and almost essential to help children anywhere in the world. But there are others who feel that when you face many millions of undernourished children in the world, the problem is one of raising the standard of living for whole populations and cannot be considered as a children's problem alone. Obviously, it seems to be that the whole picture has to be considered together, but I still think there is a need for emphasizing the part that children h...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(36%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>united world nations states part reproduction prohibited countries general rights</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(15%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>people country labor government money conditions public business areas make</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(14%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>children work women young men boys home service care training</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(9%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>york city school group education national state meeting young dr</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(6%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic6.html>mrs morning afternoon mr washington evening time night miss yesterday</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(5%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>government president soviet union people party democratic situation state communist</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
