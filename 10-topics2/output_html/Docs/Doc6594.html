                     Boston, Mass.BOSTON, Mondayâ€”When we reached the home of Miss Read and Miss Lape at Westbrook, Conn., yesterday, Miss Lape and I had a half hour's exercise before lunch. We also walked over to see the log cabin built out of the logs they salavagedsalvaged from trees blown down in the hurricane.
