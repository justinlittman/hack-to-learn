                     NEW YORK, Wednesday
                  —I was glad to see in the paper that the funds contributed by peoples throughout the world which will help restore Westminster Abbey has reached proportions which allow these restorations to be started. The overhauling will take 10 years, but certainly none of us could bear to think of Westminster Abbey not being a permanent monument, and all old buildings need repairs.
I am sure the United States has done more than its share in contributing to this fund. But then we will also get greater satisfaction probably than any other people for I think we visit Great Britain in greater numbers than any other nationality.

Many of us are not fully aware of how much our soldiers in Korea have already contributed to rehabilitation of that war-torn land.

Dr. Howard Rusk is chairman of the American-Korean Foundation and Mrs. Wendell WilkieWillkie is chairman of the women's division. American railroads are donating the use of the cars spotted around the country to collect materials which will eventually be routed to the West Coast for shipment to Korea.
I was a little troubled in reading of Mr. Brownell's recommendations for new laws in "the fight against communism".." Mr. Brownell said much had already been done to break the communist conspiracy and he told of steps planned to intensify the anti-Communist drive.
It is these steps that worry me and that I hope to understand more clearly in the near future. For instance, "A bill will allow an employer to dismiss from defense plants during a national emergency any person whose record shows that he is likely to engage in sabotage or espionage." Is not this a great departure from our old–time practices? Again there is a proposal that the "Subversive Activities Control Board will conduct hearings to determine if a union or industrial organization is ...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(21%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>people country labor government money conditions public business areas make</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(20%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>government president soviet union people party democratic situation state communist</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(16%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>united world nations states part reproduction prohibited countries general rights</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(11%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>york city school group education national state meeting young dr</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(8%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>children work women young men boys home service care training</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(7%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic7.html>mr american people time interesting good york find united made</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(7%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>people war great time country things feel today men make</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
