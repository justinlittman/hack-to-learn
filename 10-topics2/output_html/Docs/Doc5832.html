She gave the party in honor of Mrs. Frances Parkinson Keyes' new and recently published novel, "Parts Unknown." These parties are usually entertaining, for they draw a mixture of literary and social friends and I always enjoy seeing Mrs. Keyes.
In the evening I went to a parent-teachers meeting at the Central High School and then took the midnight train for New York City.

They have kindly asked me to speak and, while I am deeply appreciative of the courtesy, I hope they will not discover how nervous I am about my talk!
