                  â€”During my brief visit in Ireland with my aunt and uncle, Mr. and Mrs. David Gray, I noticed that the countryside around Dublin looked green and prosperous. The people of the Irish Free State have not suffered as the British and the other people of Europe have suffered.
They publish with pride their food exports to Great Britain. On the other hand, hard-pressed Britain has not denied them the things which they could not have had unless Britain got along with less. For instance, we and the British have seen to it that they had sufficient coal to keep their utilities going. And the Irish Free State has not been short of butter and eggs, yet in Great Britain the ration of butter is infinitesimal and you are lucky if you can buy an egg every other week.
We in the United States are also in a fortunate position. In the whole of our North and South American continents, we have been spared the ravages of war on our own soil. For this reason, I think we have a great responsibility. We should give moral and spiritual leadership as well as material aid to those nations which have such great difficulties to overcome. Our courage for the future should inspire their hope and confidence.
Material aid to these nations is also important, but we must not take away their self-respect by putting them in our debt to such an extent that they might never feel free again. This most certainly would lead to hatred of us and the old cry of "Uncle Shylock."
