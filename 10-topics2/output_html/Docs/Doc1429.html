                  â€”Election Day has come and gone and in New York Sstate the citizens elected former Governor Herbert H. Lehman as United States Senator. That speaks well, I think, for the real discrimination exercised by our citizens.
The Republicans put on an extremely active campaign in the upstate areas where they are usually overwhelmingly strong, but Governor Lehman, who has won the vote of the people of this state on a number of previous occasions, was elected.

It was gratifying to see him at his campaign headquarters last night and to be able to tell him again how much I think his victory means to the people of our state and to the people of the world. It gives us a man of heart and character and experience in many fields to represent us in the Senate.
I was happy also to congratulate Mayor William O'Dwyer on his re-electionreelection last night. In the city I think the voters were very discriminating. Stanley M. Isaacs, who is a man of integrity and liberalism, was the only Republican to make the City Council. The communist Ben Davis was turned down by the people of Harlem. On the whole, the Democrats were endorsed.
I do not think this means, however, that the Democrats do not have to make good on a liberal administration. I think the pleas made for the Mayor were on the ground that he would be the strongest advocate we had for good, clean government. He has done much to improve services for the people of the City of New York, but there remains much to be done. It must always be remembered that in the departments of a big city it requires constant vigilance to keep down graft and to keep up the stand...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(27%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>government president soviet union people party democratic situation state communist</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(15%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>day life hyde park years people world man book things</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(11%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic7.html>mr american people time interesting good york find united made</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(11%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>united world nations states part reproduction prohibited countries general rights</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(9%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic6.html>mrs morning afternoon mr washington evening time night miss yesterday</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(9%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>york city school group education national state meeting young dr</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(8%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>people war great time country things feel today men make</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(6%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>people country labor government money conditions public business areas make</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
