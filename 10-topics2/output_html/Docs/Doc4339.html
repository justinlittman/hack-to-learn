                     LONDON.â€”When we were in Haifa, we were the guests of the president of the Israel Institute of Technology, Rav-Aluf Yaakov Dori, and his wife. They told us a little of the rapid growth of the institution, which is training engineers and scientists for Israel, and smilingly referred to it as the MIT of Israel.
I am sure, however, after it has had a few more years to develop, that many students will be going there to study, just as they seek out our leading universities. We visited some of the dormitories after lunch and, much to our surprise, found that already there are a number of people from other countries. One girl came from Argentina and another from Austria.
The view from Mount Carmel, above Haifa and its harbor, is most beautiful, and driving from there to Acre was an equally lovely drive, much of it along the coast.
MAYor Gadish of Acre met us, and I was much interested to see the walls and moats that surround that old city. Our hosts talked about the Crusades and the Turkish conquest almost as if they were modern history.
We walked through some of the old streets, saw the beautiful mosque, and visited the Arab folklore exhibit. Then we were taken down to see some of the excavations that are being carried on, which showed that the city is built on another city -- and probably as they go down deeper they will find several layers representing different periods. The age of many things in Israel is surprising to those of us who live in a new country like the United States.
We had tea with a high-school teacher who is a friend of the mayor, and our talk ranged over many questions of Arab life, for it is obvious that the Arabs living in Israel are not very happy. There are a number of restrictions they must adhere to, but this is only natural in a country that is surrounded by unfriendly Arab countries. Nevertheless, it must be very hard on them not to be able to visit with ease and freedom their families and friends just across a border.
