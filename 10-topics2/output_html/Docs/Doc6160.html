                     WASHINGTON, Thursdayâ€”I have just made the rounds of every room in the White House with Mrs. Nesbitt, the housekeeper. We even inspected the third floor, which, this time, instead of housing grandchildren, will have our royal visitors' personal servants. Ordinarily, when the house is going to be filled. I tell Mrs. Nesbitt to get in touch with the nurses to find out what food should be ordered for the various children, but on this occasion I have no babies to worry about!
I have to explain, however, with extreme care certain English customs, such as early morning tea and bread and butter and water which must be cooled but must not have ice in it. Only in our own country is water with ice floating in it considered a necessity.

I am writing this column early this morning because I have an idea the rest of the day may be somewhat busy. The President told me firmly that I must ready at ten minutes before eleven. From then until the King and Queen come back to dress for the garden party at the British Embassy, I do not see that there is going to be any time for them, or for me, to do more than remove a hat!
Three of our boys with their wives arrived last night for dinner and I have talked to them all this morning on the telephone. It seems rather queer not to have them in the house, but it is certainly nice to have them in the same city. Franklin, Jr., brought his greatGreat Dane to stay until he takes him to Hyde Park, which will add a homelike touch to the South Lawn. All the shops and offices are closed for part of the day, but I notice that one is still able to get the heads of departme...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(34%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic10.html>house beautiful back morning told looked good park drive day</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(29%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic6.html>mrs morning afternoon mr washington evening time night miss yesterday</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(11%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic7.html>mr american people time interesting good york find united made</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(7%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>children work women young men boys home service care training</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(6%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>people war great time country things feel today men make</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
