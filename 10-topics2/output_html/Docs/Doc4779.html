                     HYDE PARK.—With Prime Minister Harold Macmillan of Britain now having joined the other world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly, an effort is being made on his part to get the great powers to forget the stormy beginnings of this session and to again resume disarmament talks.
I do not think much progress will be made toward real disarmament until we get down to such basic questions as Germany, the Near East and the Far East, but there is absolutely no reason why these talks should not be reopened.
Premier Nikita Khrushchev made the suggestion that five more nations be represented on the disarmament committee, and he was quite careful in naming his choice of nations, hoping they would be sufficiently neutral so that they would side with him most of the time. This may be pure wishful thinking, or he really may get an added vote or two.
He certainly, however, will succeed in making agreements more difficult if his proposal for a largeerlarger committee should be accepted, but I doubt that it will be accepted. The important thing is for everyone to get back to work on the job of trying to take even one more step on the road to disarmament—a subject about which we talk so much and on which so little materializes.
I doubt if I ever read Emily Post with great care, but I remember meeting her some years ago and have had her quoted to me by so many people that I have come to feel that she really was a valuable asset to an enormous number of people in this country.
Having reached the point where it is possible to live with greater ease and comfort than they have known in the past, many people find themselves at a loss as to the proper manners when among the so-called "society" that they now aspire to join. Then, Mrs. Post was a heaven-sent authority.
Mrs. Post was in many ways a lovely person and, I think, brought help and comfort to the young and old on many occasions. There is nothing more difficult than trying to do the right thing in situations strange to you and having no one to guide you. Here in this country we have long had a comfortable feeling that we could do pretty much as we pleased so long as we remembered that kindness underlies good manners and that the first requisite was consideration of others.
In other countries, however, there have been long-held traditions and customs, making the use of proper manners there much more difficult. I always wished there could have been an "international Mrs. Emily Post." It would mean a great deal more in cementing friendships between ourselves and other nations. For I am sure there are many American girls abroad who would love to know what to do in certain circumstances to make friends but don't dare being friendly because of the fear of makin...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(25%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>people war great time country things feel today men make</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(16%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>government president soviet union people party democratic situation state communist</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(14%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>day life hyde park years people world man book things</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(13%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>united world nations states part reproduction prohibited countries general rights</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(10%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic7.html>mr american people time interesting good york find united made</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(9%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic6.html>mrs morning afternoon mr washington evening time night miss yesterday</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
