                     Hyde ParkHYDE PARK, Mondayâ€”I am beginning to think that all the Chautauqua organizations have chosen charming spots for their settlements. We drove out to Chautauqua, Ohio, straight from the train yesterday and, as we drove into this summer resort, we passed gay parties and boats on the Miami River. The big swimming pool and tennis courts were crowded with young people. The cottages looked unpretentious, but attractive and comfortable.
I could not help thinking that it was an ideal place for children and young people to spend a healthy, pleasant summer. The audience was large and most attentive and the questions showed real interest in the subject, though there were a few personal ones like: " Is the color on your hat Eleanor Blue?" This made everybody laugh and lightened an otherwise rather solemn talk.
We caught an earlier train than we had expected and arrived home this morning at 9:30. This gave me a chance to say goodbye to Mrs. George Huntington, who is leaving for a short time, and to look over the mail and to take a ride. The ride was not very satisfactory because the flies bother the horses so much. I shall be glad when this particularly "buggy" season is over and we can use the woods again.

Some years ago it would have been impossible to know what was happening from minute to minute. I turn on my radio for the foreign news at intervals all the time. However, just as during the Republican Convention, I don't want to miss any of the colorful pageantry going on in the Democratic one.

Wilson, Chief of the Secret Service, telling me that during the past year the United States Secret Service has been trying to make the American public "counterfeit conscious",," and thereby to suppress the major crime of counterfeiting. They have used all the known ways to educate people through publicity and have succeeded in reducing the losses of the American people through counterfeiting from $1,151,839 in 1936 to $197,381 for the...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(26%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic10.html>house beautiful back morning told looked good park drive day</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(15%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic6.html>mrs morning afternoon mr washington evening time night miss yesterday</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(14%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>day life hyde park years people world man book things</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(12%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic7.html>mr american people time interesting good york find united made</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(9%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>people war great time country things feel today men make</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(8%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>children work women young men boys home service care training</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(6%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>people country labor government money conditions public business areas make</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(5%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>government president soviet union people party democratic situation state communist</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
