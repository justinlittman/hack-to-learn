                  —I hope it will not be necessary for Congress to continue the present Defense Production Act on a temporary basis simply because it will not have time to improve it and have it ready by June 30. So much time has been given to delving into our Far Eastern policy and into the recall of General MacArthur that many of the things that are vitally important to our domestic economy are coming to a head and require attention. They have been neglected in the past few weeks.
The Defense Production Act is essential, and if it is not revised it will have to be extended on a temporary basis.
I believe, for instance, that no one single thing that we do will control inflation.
I think we should have what Roger Fleming, who is secretary of the Farm Bureau Federation, suggested on my television program. He said heavier taxes are necessary, particularly where profits have been unusually high, and he urged the curtailment of certain types of credit, particularly where these credits permit the public to compete in buying things that will be scarce and require materials which will also be required for defense purposes.

I don't happen to like rationing any better than anyone else, but if liberal rationing will make it easier to make all people share alike what goods will be on the market—particularly those bound to become scarcer—I would be willing to see rationing put into effect. If this becomes necessary, however, I hope it would be on a very liberal basis, because we are not proposing to curtail our general production in the way we would have to do if we were in an all-out war.
