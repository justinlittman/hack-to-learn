                     Hyde ParkHYDE PARK, Wednesdayâ€”The two hours I spent at the N. Y. Herald Tribune Forum yesterday afternoon were most interesting, but I am troubled by the impression that people are thinking and talking today as though everything being done is in preparation for going to war. I suppose different people would explain the cause for this state of mind in different ways.
The reason seems immaterial to me. The important thing is that we should stop allowing our thoughts to run along this line.
