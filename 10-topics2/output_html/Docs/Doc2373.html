The men who occupy political positions in an area of a big community are known and looked up to for help and advice by practically everyone in their district. If they succumb to the temptations of private profit gained in questionable ways, if they associate with known criminals and gloss over their activities, what can you expect of the children of the area who live under circumstances where temptations of a minor kind constantly confront them? Why should they resist if their elders do...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(18%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>day life hyde park years people world man book things</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(12%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>people war great time country things feel today men make</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(12%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic7.html>mr american people time interesting good york find united made</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(11%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>children work women young men boys home service care training</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(10%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>people country labor government money conditions public business areas make</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(10%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>york city school group education national state meeting young dr</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(7%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>government president soviet union people party democratic situation state communist</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(7%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>united world nations states part reproduction prohibited countries general rights</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(6%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic10.html>house beautiful back morning told looked good park drive day</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(6%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic6.html>mrs morning afternoon mr washington evening time night miss yesterday</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
