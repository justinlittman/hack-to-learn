                     NEW YORK.â€”Anyone who watched and listened to the new delegate to the United Nations from Iraq must have been interested to hear him remark that no blood had been shed in their taking over of the government. When reminded that three leaders had died, he made rather light of it and said that was only due to their own action not to those who brought about the coup d'etat!
Then we read in the newspapers the other morning that "an Iraqi Army officer" threatened the life of the representative of the pre-revolutionary government of Iraq to the United Nations.
This does not sound so peaceful, and it does not look as though any of the governments under the influence of the Soviet Union are being very peaceful.

There undoubtedly was discontent in Iraq among the people, which the army capitalized on in order to take over. They now call the government a republic.

I think we are moving in the right direction by insisting that any summit meeting on the Middle East problems be held within the United Nations. One suggestion that I read proposed that the Security Council nominate a subcommittee to which the heads of Great Britain, France, the United States, the Soviet Union, and India would be appointed. This would certainly accomplish the result of calling together the heads of nations for a summit conference.
It will be interesting to the women of our country to see that the Assistant Chairman of the Republican National Committee, Bertha S. Adkins, has been nominated by the President to be Under Secretary of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare. She has had some experience as Dean of Women in two colleges, and since I hope that women in the United States are deeply interested in the basic changes needed in our educational system, this appointment may prove to be one of the very im...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(33%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>government president soviet union people party democratic situation state communist</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(25%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>united world nations states part reproduction prohibited countries general rights</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(8%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>people war great time country things feel today men make</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(8%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>york city school group education national state meeting young dr</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(7%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic7.html>mr american people time interesting good york find united made</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(5%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>day life hyde park years people world man book things</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
