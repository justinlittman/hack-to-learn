                  —Yesterday morning I went to Brooklyn for the christening of one of our new super-carriers, the Franklin D. Roosevelt. There is something overwhelming in the size of such a ship when you see it in drydock before the water is let in to float it. It was the first time I had seen a ship launched in this way, and I don't think it gives one quite the same thrill as when you hear the hammer strokes knocking out the supports and see the ship suddenly begin to move down the ways.

He had the faculty of reading blueprints and seeing a ship or a building as it would ultimately be—just as he could read a road map and actually recognize the lay of the land, when we traveled through any part of the country.
