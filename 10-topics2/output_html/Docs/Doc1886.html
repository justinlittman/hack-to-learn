                     GENEVA, Friday
                  â€”I had a letter the other day from a lady whom I take to be young and enterprising. She had just read in the papers a protest against women taking positions in government and asserting that they should stay home in their own kitchens. The article ended with an encomium for Mrs. Truman for minding her own affairs.
The writer ends her letter in this way: "I personally feel that it is the job of every woman to be as good a citizen as she can be, by giving all the time she can spare to public enterprises and the field of politics. It is my feeling also that the kitchen is a good place to formulate these ideas, but one must get far from the kitchen to carry them out."
It seems to me that the lady is right. There are a good many people who must stay at home and who cannot take an active part outside the home. When that is the case they can at least intelligently perform the minimum duties as a citizen and probably no more.
Mrs. Truman has done far more. She has done all that has been expected of the wife of the President and has followed in the footsteps of many fine women who have lived in the White House before her, who were fine wives and mothers and charming hostesses. These are all things that every President's wife must strive to do to the best of her ability.
There are other women, however, who have the time and ability to take as active a part in public affairs as men. When that is the case I think it is well to encourage them to do so and to be grateful that we can have the benefit of the point of view of both men and women in public life. It is essential in home life and nearly all the phases of community activity, so we cannot fail to profit when it is possible to have both men and women active in public life. This is particularly true now...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(21%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>children work women young men boys home service care training</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(15%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>united world nations states part reproduction prohibited countries general rights</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(11%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>york city school group education national state meeting young dr</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(11%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>day life hyde park years people world man book things</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(9%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>people country labor government money conditions public business areas make</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(9%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic7.html>mr american people time interesting good york find united made</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(9%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic6.html>mrs morning afternoon mr washington evening time night miss yesterday</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(7%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>government president soviet union people party democratic situation state communist</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
