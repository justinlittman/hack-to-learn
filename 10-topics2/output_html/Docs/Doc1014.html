                  —Last night we listened to Senator Alben Barkley's speech at the Democratic National Convention. It must have been a trying occasion, for the heat in that Convention Hall, packed with people, must have reminded many of the heat in Chicago in 1932.
As a keynote speech, it was a masterpiece, I thought, reminding the people of the country of many things that the Republican party would like to have them forget.
