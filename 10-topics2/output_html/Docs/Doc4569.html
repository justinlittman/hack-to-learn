                     NEW YORK. 
                  —I think I must tell you of my experiences in some of the bad weather that we had just before Christmas. The reason I want to tell you about them is that I suddenly realized what a friendly city New York is. It can be really like a village and people, on the whole, often prove themselves to be so very kindly.
We had both rain and snow for several days and the city was crowded with out-of-town guests and shoppers, and taxis were practically unobtainable. I was standing in the rain one day, knowing that I had an appointment a mile or two away for a regular osteopathic treatment. Every taxi that came along was filled.

I was standing on Park Avenue near my apartment, trying again to get a taxicab to get way downtown by 7:30 p.m. Finally, a Carey car came along and the driver stopped and asked if he could not take me to my destination after he had left his passengers at a restaurant. The gentleman whose car it was kindly said that he and his guests were quite willing to have the driver do this, so I got in beside the driver and after the stop at a restaurant he drove me all the way downtown.
