                     Hyde ParkHYDE PARK, Wednesdayâ€”Yesterday afternoon went quietly on its way. Some of us took a walk and returned to the big house for tea, where we found Johnny and AnnaAnne and their little dachshund, "Percy",," had arrived from Boston. I think what I enjoy most about these "historic" occasions is that they bring together what family there is within reach, and we sometimes hear by telephone, at least, the voices of the rest of the family.
Quite a large group came to a picnic supper at the cottage, but by 9:00 o'clock we were back at the big house. We sat around radios in the different rooms and received news from the news services and from the various people who telephoned to the President.
