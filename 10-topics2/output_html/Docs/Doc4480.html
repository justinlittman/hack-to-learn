                     MANSFIELD, Pa..â€”The American Veterans of the Elbe River Link-Up, through one of its active members, Mr. Joseph Polowsky, has written to remind me that the organization on Elbe Day, April 25, 1958, presented to President Eisenhower at the White House a bratina. This is a large, wooden, lacquered drinking bowl of friendship, famed in Russian history.
In return for having originally received this bratina from the Russians, on V-E Day, May 9, 1959, in Premier Khrushchev's office in the Kremlin the organization presented to the Premier the original patrol map used by the first American patrol to link up with the Soviet forces at the Elbe River during the wartime alliance between our two countries.
Mr. Polowsky writes me that the tradition of the bratina is that those who drink together out of the bowl will never raise their arms in anger at each other. And he suggests that it might be well for the President to take this bowl to Camp David with him so that it might be used in a ritual of friendship during his talks with Mr. Khrushchev. Since the tradition is Russian, Mr. Khrushchev could hardly object to the effort being made to bring about what he says he has come here to work for!
Now, let's turn to a domestic question, which I think more people should know about.
There has been in our courts a long controversy as to whether teachers who have willingly given evidence as far as their own connection with communism is concerned should be forced to give information regarding other people's association with Communists and communism.
These teachers have legally won their point and, rightly, should be returned to their teaching positions. This, however, has not been done by the New York City Board of Education and, it seems to me, it should be done before the case is entirely closed.
There is an effort being made by Edwin T. Randall of Friendly World Broadcasting, Wallingford, Pa., to provide five- and sevenminute conversations on tape that can be used by radio-stations in various parts of the country. He also is trying to distribute a 15-minute weekly program, which he calls "This Is a Friendly World," and he is producing it this year in cooperation with the American Library Association. The latter deals largely with world understanding and is based on the firm conv...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(20%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>york city school group education national state meeting young dr</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(20%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>government president soviet union people party democratic situation state communist</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(17%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic7.html>mr american people time interesting good york find united made</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(11%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>united world nations states part reproduction prohibited countries general rights</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(7%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>people war great time country things feel today men make</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(5%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic10.html>house beautiful back morning told looked good park drive day</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(5%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>people country labor government money conditions public business areas make</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(5%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>day life hyde park years people world man book things</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(5%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>children work women young men boys home service care training</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
