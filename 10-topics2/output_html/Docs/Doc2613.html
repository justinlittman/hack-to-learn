                     NEW YORK, Thursday
                  â€”The sad news came to us yesterday evening of Ed Flynn's death. I am glad he and Mrs. Flynn and their daughter, Sheila, were having a happy trip together because that will be a memory to cherish for both his wife and daughter.
Ed Flynn was my husband's warm friend and wise counselor. He was the Democratic leader in the Bronx, but as a man he was far more than a political boss. He knew and understood what the New Deal really meant.

Iran is certainly an exciting spot to be in at the moment!
One day you hear that the Prime Minister is successful and that the Shah has left Iran and the next day the papers tell you that the rebels have thrown out the Prime Minister and that the Shah is returning immediately.
The Middle East is full of unrest, but I don't think the actual ruler is as important as what can be done in the way of reforms that will really change the life of the people. Until the people in this area of the world really see that efforts are being made to improve their standard of living I cannot see how there can be any change toward stability. People who are hungry, people who have very little hope of improved living standards for themselves and their children are not going to s...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(21%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>government president soviet union people party democratic situation state communist</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(21%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>united world nations states part reproduction prohibited countries general rights</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(14%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>day life hyde park years people world man book things</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(11%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>people war great time country things feel today men make</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(9%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>york city school group education national state meeting young dr</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(9%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic6.html>mrs morning afternoon mr washington evening time night miss yesterday</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(7%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic10.html>house beautiful back morning told looked good park drive day</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
