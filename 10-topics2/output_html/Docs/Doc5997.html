                     Warm Springs, Ga.WARM SPRINGS, Ga.missingerpp, Friday—At 6:30 last evening, the President and I drove down to Georgia Hall for Thanksgiving dinner with the patients and other guests. At 7:00 o'clock, Central time, the President went on the air and many of you may have heard his short speech in which he told the patients of the beginnings of the Warm Springs Foundation, the steps which have followed, and the situation as it is today.

She doesn't sleep very well and finds that she sometimes wakes up at night with bright ideas which might be expanded into an article, and so she writes them on the wall paper—which, she says, isn't very good for the wall paper!
