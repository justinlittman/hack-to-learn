                     WASHINGTON, Wednesdayâ€”Yesterday afternoon I stopped at Mr. Walter Russell's studio to see the bust of the President, on which he had made some changes. I think it is very good indeed. I admire greatly the quality of strength and patience he has put into it, which does not obscure a sense of humor which is always lurking in the background.
Last evening I attended two meetings held at Teacher'sTeachers College, Columbia University. Miss Mabel Carney, who organized them, was with difficulty induced to appear on the stage at each meeting, so that the speakers and audience could express their appreciation of the work she has so long carried on.
I caught the night train and arrived in Washington in time to have a glimpse at breakfast of three young people, who are on their way home from the International Student Service Summer Institute at Asheville, N. C.
This afternoon the President and I shall meet the Queen of the Netherlands at the station. This will be her really formal reception in this country.
I wonder if many cities can boast of the success which Boston seems to have with its Victory Gardens. They are actually planning to have a Victory Garden Show at Horticultural Hall, on September 28th, 29th and 30th, and to give War Stamps and Bonds to the lucky prize winners. They include among their competitors surburban residents who have had large gardens, but also allow entries from the lowly apartment resident who has grown one vegetable in his window box!
Boston evidently took the admonitions of the Department of Agriculture seriously. You will remember that we were told that no time, energy and vital materials were to be used on land which would not, and could not, bring forth a good harvest. So they are going to prove that even though Boston is a great city, it is still sufficiently near the soil to have a garden show of prize products. I think they should be congratulated and I am sure there are many other places which could do the same...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(22%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic6.html>mrs morning afternoon mr washington evening time night miss yesterday</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(16%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>york city school group education national state meeting young dr</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(13%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>children work women young men boys home service care training</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(12%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic7.html>mr american people time interesting good york find united made</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(9%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>people country labor government money conditions public business areas make</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(9%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>day life hyde park years people world man book things</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(8%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>people war great time country things feel today men make</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(6%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic10.html>house beautiful back morning told looked good park drive day</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
