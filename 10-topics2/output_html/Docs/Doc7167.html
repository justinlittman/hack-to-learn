                     New York CityNEW YORK, Thursdayâ€”One of the things a great many of us are worried about today is the possibility of inflation. We are told that if we deny ourselvesasourselves as many things as possible, we may be able to divert the production power which would ordinarily flow into the making of consumer goods, into the production of things which are vitally needed in the war effort.
