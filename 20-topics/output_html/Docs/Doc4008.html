                     NEW YORK.â€”I have just received the trade magazine of the Campbell Soup Company, on the cover of which is an editorial the author asked me to read.
The author evidently thinks that we need some persuasion in this country to prove to ourselves that freedom has value. I would have thought this was something which had been established at the time of our Revolution, but to equate freedom with any form of economy seems to be a false evaluation of our basic belief.
I would like to take his statements and try to disprove them, for I do not think it wise to tie ourselves to any one specific economic theory to meet every situation, and to tie that to the basic concept of freedom seems to me even more impossible.
The gentleman begins with this statement: "Under socialism or communism, you must work for the government because the government is the only employer."
Here at once he has made socialism and communism the same thing. There are a great many Socialists who would disspute this and who are indignant because the Communist leaders of the Soviet Union and of Yugoslavia are trying to do this very thing. There is no question, however, but that under communism the government is the only employer.
Second, he says: "Under socialism or communism you must butbuy everything from the government because the government makes and supplies everything. There is little or no choice in price or quality."
I would say the second statement is untrue.
Third, "Under socialism and communism, the government plans everything, including who will do what kind of work and how many will do it. The government decides which, if any, of our children is to be educated."
Under communism, the government does do planning, but it does not decide who will be educated. That depends on the individual's ability to learn. The government provides more and more universal opportunity for education, but tests are given for ability all along the line.
Four, "Under socialism or communism, there is no place to invest the money you save, except with the government which doesn't even have to pay interest if if doesn't want to."
Since this is communism, there is no such thing as capital investment. People live on their salaries, and what money they put in the bank and save they can use. But there is no such thing as investment, so you do not invest with the government because it doesn't offer you the opportunity. You can, however, loan money to the government if it can persuade you that it is your patriotic duty to do so. But you know beforehand that you will more than likely never see your money again, or t...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(25%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic17.html>people country business great living pay money make things time</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(23%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic18.html>world soviet nations united union countries war government communist peace</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(16%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>government labor people public conditions make point question situation part</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(7%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>people country world american citizens states south democracy freedom nation</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
