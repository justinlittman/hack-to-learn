Organizations and industries are convinced that women are worth much advertising directed at them exclusively, but when it comes to their political interests women seem to be very poor subscribers. Apparently, they think the support of the women's work within the party should...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(23%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic15.html>president state party democratic senator congress political york bill vote</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(14%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic6.html>men war women work service home great army red copyright</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(12%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic10.html>children care program health year hospital public work money medical</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(7%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic7.html>morning home park mrs back hyde husband family mother yesterday</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(6%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>government labor people public conditions make point question situation part</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(6%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>world day park hyde year country hope people today part</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(5%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>mr york good time play made copyright united feature syndicate</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
