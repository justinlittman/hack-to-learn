                     WASHINGTON, Sunday—We left Hyde Park early Friday morning, changed trains in New York City and came straight through to Washington, to find ourselves slightly warmer on arrival than we had been in the early morning hours at Hyde Park.

In many communities, Catholic, Protestant and Jewish Churcheschurches are working together, and sometimes the auxiliaries send home townhometown newspapers to the boys far from home. Often they get together and send Christmas boxes.
