                     HYDE PARK.—The opening of the 90-day celebration to commemorate Henry Hudson's discovery of the Hudson River took place this week in New York City. We very often forget the origin of many names that have become so familiar to us, so I think it is good to be reminded of the discoverers of our great rivers and other areas by these periodic celebrations.
This year marks the 350th anniversary of Henry Hudson's arrival at the mouth of the Hudson River, and New York and New Jersey are both playing a part.

Mr. William Zeckendorf, president of New York City's Hudson Celebration Committee, was master of ceremonies.
How interesting it is to read that two portraits of Thomas Jefferson have just been found—and both on the same canvas!

The whole story of how the canvas was found, and of the patient work done by Orland Campbell, is most interesting.
The other night I attended a meeting in Harlem to start off a new neighborhood association which is endeavoring to bring together the people of the area in the hope of improving conditions. In this section of New York City housing is very badly overcrowded, buildings are allowed to deteriorate, and children grow up with little pride in their surroundings, which is one reason for them becoming very destructive of property.
An area such as Harlem costs the residents of the rest of the city more money than would a good community, because the major part of all taxes has to be spent on the needs of the people who live in an area of this kind. As a rule there are more crimes and more illness, the schools are poorer, and mental health generally is at its lowest ebb in such areas. It would pay the citizens of New York City as a whole to take an interest in backing up a group like the Harlem Neighborhood Associati...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(11%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic16.html>school children young work education city community boys schools training</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(10%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>world day park hyde year country hope people today part</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(9%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic19.html>great husband years story syndicate called interesting life lived feature</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(8%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>washington time yesterday book interesting things work find read day</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(7%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic15.html>president state party democratic senator congress political york bill vote</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(7%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>people country world american citizens states south democracy freedom nation</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(7%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic10.html>children care program health year hospital public work money medical</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(6%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic11.html>land told small country good part area farm food visited</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(6%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>mr york good time play made copyright united feature syndicate</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(5%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>american meeting united dr students college university group association york</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
