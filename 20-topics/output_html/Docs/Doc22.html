                     NEW YORK, Thursday
                  â€”Removal of the curfew and the racing ban, with the promise also that reconversion will begin in certain industries and that holders of "A" cards may get a little more gasoline in the future, are naturally accepted by everyone as tangible proofs that part of the war burden is being eased.

This was begun last year at the request of the President's War Relief Control Board upon the recommendation of the American Mission in New Delhi.
Their first contributions came from the big labor groups in this country and from Governor Richard Casey of Bengal. Now they must appeal to the people of this country to give month by month what they feel are the absolute necessities for the people of India.

Many of our men are fighting in India today and will come home and tell us of the people there and their difficulties. Very few of us here have any conception of the problems which the people of India face in the development of unity in their nation, nor do we understand what problems the British Government and the people of India will eventually have to work out.
