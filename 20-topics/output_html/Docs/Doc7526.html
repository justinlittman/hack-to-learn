                     Hyde ParkHYDE PARK, Friday â€”Yesterday morning, I left my New York Cityapartment fairly early and wontwent upto the colored orphan asylum in Riverdale, with some members of the board and interested friends.

At the present time, work for our children is particularly important because of the rise in juvenile delinquency. One of the aims of Better Parenthood Week in 1943 is to :" : "Lend active support to all efforts in behalf of maternal and child health, improved nutrition, better schools and vocational training, friendlier relations between different origins and beliefs."
