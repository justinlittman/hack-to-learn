                     EN ROUTE TO PORTLAND, Tuesday
                  —At the luncheon of the Council on Foreign Relations in Chicago yesterday, I was asked a question which I thought had been answered over and over again—namely, "What are the chief objections to our taking in some of the displaced persons in Europe?"
Even if Congress approves an appropriation—which I hope it will very soon—for our share in the International Refugee Organization, we will be able to do only half the job unless we can lead the way in accepting some of these people in our own country and getting them started on new and constructive lives. To do that we not only need the money, but we need a temporary law which would allow the use of immigration quotas which were unfilled during the war years.
By law, we allow 150,000 people to enter this country every year. But only about one-fifth of that number are actually entering because some of the countries with the highest quotas are sending us practically no immigrants today. And during the war, we received very few people because of the dangers of travel and the difficulties of leaving war-torn countries.
If that slight change in our immigration law was made for a period of a few years, we could accept some 400,000 people into this country, under the same careful scrutiny that all immigrants have to undergo for health. It is practically impossible for any immigrant to become a charge on the community today since individuals or organizations have to go bond for them.
I sometimes wonder how much people really know about the displaced persons. I am frequently asked if all of those waiting to come over here are Jewish.

Having been the ones most cruelly attacked under the Hitler regime, the Jews probably have the least resistance and have been dying in greater numbers than any others. The majority of the people still in camps are Poles, Balts, ...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(24%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic20.html>united nations world prohibited rights states part reproduction general human</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(9%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic13.html>people time york city find long good kind christmas make</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(8%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic17.html>people country business great living pay money make things time</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(7%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>american meeting united dr students college university group association york</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(7%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic10.html>children care program health year hospital public work money medical</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(7%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>people country world american citizens states south democracy freedom nation</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(5%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic18.html>world soviet nations united union countries war government communist peace</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(5%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>government labor people public conditions make point question situation part</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(5%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic6.html>men war women work service home great army red copyright</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
