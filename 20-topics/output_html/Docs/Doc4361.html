                     NEW YORK.â€”On last Sunday morning in two New York newspapers I read front-page stories about a group of men who took a Negro from a prison in Mississippi, where he was awaiting trial on an accusation of possible rape of a white woman, and beat him and removed him to parts unknown. He had been left unguarded, at least so the story was told, and the mob just walked in and took him out of his cell.
Up to the time I write this no one has been found who could be charged with the responsibility for the kind of cruelty for which we and our three allies at the end of World War II tried the makers of policy in Nazi Germany.
We have not reached the point as yet, thank God, when mass murders of people in gas chambers are going on, but when a mob does not wait for the action of the law, then you are no longer a law-abiding nation.
This occurrence in Mississippi was not something that could be shrugged off by the rest of the country by saying: "Well, this is unfortunate. But it did not happen in our community." Nor can it be explained that it happened in a particular area where people are so conditioned by their past that their emotions have led them to forget their obligation to be law-abiding citizens.
This was something about which we all have some responsibility. If we in other parts of the country do not express our feelings of shock at such conduct, then we are as guilty as the men who actually were in the kidnapping group.
It was only a few people who decided that they wished to eliminate a certain group of people in Germany, but it grew to such dimensions that 6,000,000 Jews died in the prison camps. When you begin to allow yourself to override the law you do not know where you will end. When you begin to allow yourself a kind of self-righteous prejudice against another race or another religion, you do not know what the end may be, and in the end you may suffer as did those who sowed the seeds of World War...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(24%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>people country world american citizens states south democracy freedom nation</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(21%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic12.html>people life man things human years read thing feel live</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(9%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic15.html>president state party democratic senator congress political york bill vote</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(8%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic18.html>world soviet nations united union countries war government communist peace</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(7%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>world day park hyde year country hope people today part</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(6%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic6.html>men war women work service home great army red copyright</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(5%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic13.html>people time york city find long good kind christmas make</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
