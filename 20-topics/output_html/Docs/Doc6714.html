                     WASHINGTON, Mondayâ€”On the way up yesterday, there was some doubt as to whether we would be able to fly out of Charleston, S.C., in the late afternoon. To my joy,unremarkable. I found the weather had cleared and we were able to carry out our plan of spending five hours in Charleston and then flying on to Washington.
Mrs. George Huntington met us at the airport and drove us first to the Cypress Gardens.

To me, the enormous and graceful live oak trees are more marvelous even than the acres and acres of beautifully laid out gardens.
