                     Joplin, Mo.JOPLIN, Mo., Sundayâ€”One pleasant thing about traveling is the opportunity it gives you to see your friends and acquaintances. It was delightful to change trains at Chicago on Friday and be met again by an old newspaper friend, and then to find Mrs. Cotsworth and her daughter, and Mrs. Flynn of the Burlington Railroad all there to greet me.
