                  â€”I have just received some rather startling and even shocking material on a crisis which faces the cities of our nation as a result of the deteriorating slum conditions that exist almost everywhere. I think all of us should become more aware of this crisis than we seem to be at present.
New York City alone, for example, has 7,000 acres of slums, with some of the worst areas in Harlem. If the density of the population of Harlem were applied throughout the city, all the people of the United States would be housed in Manhattan!
Various factors have contributed to the worsening of slum conditions in our cities. Those who can afford to get away from the big cities, for example, move to the suburbs, and in recent years the greatest migration throughout our country has been of this kind. The result is that the city dwellers who are left behind are more and more going to be predominantly in the low-income group. And of this group, the larger proportion are non-white.
Washington, D. C. is already more than 50 per centpercent non-white. In six years the Los Angeles non-white population increased 45 per centpercent, while the white population increased only 12 per centpercent. New York's non-white population is up 41 per centpercent as against a six per centpercent increase in its white population.

What it means is that we have to modernize all of our cities, and the best place to start is with the slums. Today we have 22 million slum dwellers in our cities as against 20 million farmers. Our Federal expenditure per farm family is $3,000 per year as against $84 spent on the slum family.
