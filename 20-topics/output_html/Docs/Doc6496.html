                     Hyde ParkHYDE PARK, Fridayâ€”There was a nice little ceremony at the library when the key was finally turned over to Mr. R.D.unremarkable W. Connor the Archivist of the United States. The President was gently reminded by him that the building now waited for his papers. The prompt answer was that 32 cases of books, papers and prints were already there, and more were on the way.
After the flag was raised in front of the library, we came over to my cottage and gradually all the people who are my closest neighbors, from grandparents to babies, began to gather. A little after 4:00 o'clock, the President drove up. He read the Declaration of Independence, leaving out only the part which has direct reference to our situation in 1776.

Mr. Catanese was really remarkable, for he was able to play almost any song that was suggested if someone just hummed the tune. Everyone enjoyed Mr. Bower'sBowers' singing. I was sorry that a call from the Secretary of State took the President back to the big house about 8:00 o'clock and made everybody else go back to work.
I was moved to a patriotic feeling today by the little ceremony with our neighbors around the flagpole, because it is so significant of what we stand for in this country. The President of the United States observing this Fourth of July with his neighbors in that close companionship which should exist between all of us in this democratic nation, challenged the relationships in the totalitarian countries.
