                     WASHINGTON, Thursdayâ€”The Mayor of Cincinnati, Ohio;, Rabbi Wohl, with several other members of the Forum met us at the train at 8:00 o'clock yesterday morning. I am always a little overwhelmed by these early morning attentions, because I feel that the hosts put themselves out so tremendously and nothing you can do or say can really repay them.
They drove us to the hotel and left us to eat our breakfast, and at 9:30 the press appeared. I did a little work on the broadcast for civilian defense, which I made at 1:15, and saw some of the staff of the volunteer bureau, which is already established here, though still without a local defense set-upsetup.

He tells me that it is made by a little shop that refuses to be commercialized, remains the same size, keeps the same saleswomen, and will not acquire a large clientileclientele. I can testify that it is some of the best candy I have ever eaten.
We went to the lecture without dinner, and returned to some delicousdelicious creamed chicken and milk, which fortified us for our night of travel.
I visited two of our schools in the District of Columbia this morning, one for white children and one for colored children. They are putting on a program for civilian defense. I have a plea from the military chairman of the waste paper conservation campaign, in which she tells me that everybody is being asked to conserve waste paper. Papers that lie about the house, or any package that comes in, should have its wrappings removed at once and put into a convenient place to turn over to the...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(16%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic6.html>men war women work service home great army red copyright</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(14%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>washington time yesterday book interesting things work find read day</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(11%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>mrs evening dinner morning mr afternoon miss clock president house</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(8%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic13.html>people time york city find long good kind christmas make</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(7%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic17.html>people country business great living pay money make things time</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(6%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic7.html>morning home park mrs back hyde husband family mother yesterday</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(5%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic11.html>land told small country good part area farm food visited</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(5%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic10.html>children care program health year hospital public work money medical</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(5%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>mr york good time play made copyright united feature syndicate</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
