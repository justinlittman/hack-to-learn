                     HYDE PARK, Sunday
                  â€”On Friday I saw the workings of a TV control room during the Tex and Jinx show. I must say it is a very busy place, and certainly gives one an understanding of how complicated it is to put on a TV performance.
We went afterwards into the studio where the show was being produced. With us was my old friend, John Golden, and somewhat to his surprise he found himself being photographed on TV, something which he assured me he had no intention of being done! He prefers the radio, where you are heard but not seen. However, these little impromptu shots in a long program are what make Tex and Jinx's show entertaining and unexpected.
I am constantly surprised to have Mr. Golden tell me that some friend of his is opposed to the U.N., on the ground that it has no value and accomplishes nothing. His answer, I believe, is about as good an answer as anyone can give to people who are thinking along what seems to me illogical lines. Mr. Golden replies: "If you can think of anything better, propose it. But in the meantime, isn't it essential to try to use the U.N. as far as we can, since it is the only thing we have to use?"
It also seems to me that people who make this objection are usually unaware of anything which goes on in the U.N. beyond the meetings in New York City. They rarely know much about the work of the specialized agencies, of the technical assistance plan, or of the Children's Fund. I am sure if they made a study of the day-by-day activities of these agencies, they would at least acknowledge the value of this work in creating an atmosphere of greater understanding among the peoples of the world...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(24%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>mr york good time play made copyright united feature syndicate</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(8%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>people country world american citizens states south democracy freedom nation</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(7%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic13.html>people time york city find long good kind christmas make</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(7%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic10.html>children care program health year hospital public work money medical</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(6%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic20.html>united nations world prohibited rights states part reproduction general human</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(6%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic17.html>people country business great living pay money make things time</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(6%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>government labor people public conditions make point question situation part</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(5%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic7.html>morning home park mrs back hyde husband family mother yesterday</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(5%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>washington time yesterday book interesting things work find read day</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(5%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>mrs evening dinner morning mr afternoon miss clock president house</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
