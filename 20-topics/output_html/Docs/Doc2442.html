                     NEW YORK, Friday
                  â€”I have been getting up rather early the past few days. On Tuesday morning I left Hyde Park by a 6:30 train in order to make the 10:20 plane for Raleigh, N.C., and on Thursday I left The Inn in Chapel Hill at 6:15 to make the 7:30 plane back to New York City.
Nevertheless, I promised to tell you what I did while I was there, so here goes. My plane was an hour late on the way down because of foggy weather. Mrs. William B.

The Woman's College, of course, always reminds me of Miss Harriet EliottElliott, who headed it for so many years and left it on several occasions to work in Washington during my husband's Administration, each time making a real contribution to her national government.
I was still answering the girls' questions when a contingent of boys arrived with the Dean of Men from Chapel Hill. We soon started on our drive to Chapel Hill. As I had a few minutes to spare on arrival, I went out to see Dr. and Mrs. Will Alexander at their farm. Dr. Alexander had been ill and for the first time had gone out to walk, so I missed him, and this was a real disappointment.
