                  —As I mentioned in my column yesterday, I read a newspaper article recently which said that charges of communism had been made against Mr. and Mrs. Clifford Durr and Mr. Aubrey Williams. I was astounded to learn of these accusations, and I should like to say something in their defense.
Mrs. Clifford Durr I knew when I was in Washington, and she was devoted to progress in this country. She believed that discrimination against anyone was harmful to our nation—and she came from the South! She also believed in the rights of labor.
Perhaps coming from the South, she was more conscious than some of us are of the fact that it was still difficult for an organizer to be safe if he tried to form a labor union in certain Southern mill towns. She did not like Ku Klux Klan or vigilante methods. She believed that people had a right to choose what they wanted to do, and if they wanted to have a union, they had a right to have it.
I am not surprised that she denied ever having been a Communist but I wish she might have said what she really believed in. I think she would have said, "I am a Democrat and a liberal." If it is now conceded that anyone who does not believe in discrimination and who does believe in certain fundamental rights of labor is a Communist, then I think there are a good many Communists in this country. It would be well to have it clearly understood, if this is the way some people are understanding...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(20%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic18.html>world soviet nations united union countries war government communist peace</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(14%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>government labor people public conditions make point question situation part</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(13%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>people country world american citizens states south democracy freedom nation</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(8%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic15.html>president state party democratic senator congress political york bill vote</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(7%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic20.html>united nations world prohibited rights states part reproduction general human</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(6%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic12.html>people life man things human years read thing feel live</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
