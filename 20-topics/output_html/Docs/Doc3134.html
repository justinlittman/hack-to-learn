                     NEW YORK.
                  —On Friday night of last week I went to the theatre to see "Witness for the Prosecution".."
The two gentlemen with me argued violently as to the innocence, of which they were convinced, of the person who really committed the crime. I was somewhat more cautious, but I confess that the last act was a surprise even to me.
I think the play is very good but it certainly does require at least two extraordinarily good actors, and it is fortunate to have them in Gene Lyons and Patricia Jessel.

These old letters always make fascinating reading, taking one back to the daily lives of people in the past. They lived far apart in those days, and there was far less opportunity for meeting. It also was harder to send letters than it is today, so when a letter was sent it covered every inch of the paper and sometimes the paper was crisscrossed.
