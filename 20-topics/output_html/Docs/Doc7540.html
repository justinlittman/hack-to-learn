                     WASHINGTON, Monday—Yesterday was a quiet day. I enjoyed very much my luncheon guests—nine veterans back from the war, who are studying at George Washington University here. Four of them brought their wives and I know that one, at least, had a six-months-oldsix-month-old baby at home. These men are getting a chance for an education which we hope will fit them to take a useful place in the world of the future.
I was interested to find that two with whom I talked—one taking a law course, the other a course in public administration—are doing so because they wish to take part later in some field of government activity. One, in particular, hopes to run for office some daysomeday and told me he wanted to have a hand in making the world the kind of world for which they fought. I hope that is going to be the attitude of a great many men.
The other day, I was sent by Judge William Denman, of San Francisco, a poem which was published in the San Francisco"Call-Bulletin." I have permission to reprint it here:
The author is not a well known poetess, but perhaps we may hear more in the future of Mrs. Nell Griffith Wilson of Kenwood, SonomaCounty, California. In any case, I think there is many a woman who feels, whether she has a son of her own or not on the fighting front, that she is grateful to have a share in saving other mother'smothers' sons.
