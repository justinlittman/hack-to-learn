                     WASHINGTON, Monday —This morning, I saw a heading in the newspaper which distrubed me very much. On reading the story, it appeared that one of our admirals was before a committee in Congress and reported that the Walsh—Healey bill was creating contractual difficulties and retarding the defense program.
He asserted that this act, under which firms accepting government contracts are required to meet certain labor standards fixed by their industries: "continues to be a disturbing factor in the procurement of some lines of government supplies."

I think it is often forgotten that it is the red tape surrounding the government work which deters people as much as any legal restrictions. Payment is slow and many difficulties arise which do not arise in private contracts.

The workers can do nothing, I grant you, without the men at the top and what they represent in capital investment and in ability and experience. It is quite evident that this a co-operativecooperative job. Sacrifices will have to be equal.
