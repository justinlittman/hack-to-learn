                     New York CityNEW YORK, Tuesdayâ€”The Cabinet ladies gave their lunch at the White House for the ladies of the Senate yesterday, but, unfortunately, because of the cold and wind, it was held in the large dining room instead of out of doors. We looked wistfully at the grass and trees outside, for picnicking there is really half the fun of this particular group.
After it was over I went up to say a few words at the meeting of the Temple Sisterhood, and at 5:00 I went to Mrs. George Barnett's for tea. She gave the party in honor of Mrs. Frances Parkinson Keyes' new and recently published novel, "Parts Unknown." These parties are usually entertaining, for they draw a mixture of literary and social friends and I always enjoy seeing Mrs. Keyes.
In the evening I went to a parent-teachers meeting at the Central High School and then took the midnight train for New York City.
A number of errands have filled my day and I had the pleasure of seeing friends at lunch and tea. Shortly, I must be ready to attend the American Booksellers Association dinner. They have kindly asked me to speak and, while I am deeply appreciative of the courtesy, I hope they will not discover how nervous I am about my talk! I am to discourse about books to a group of people who know much more than I could ever know on the subject and who could probably make a much more interesting speech....</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(20%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>mrs evening dinner morning mr afternoon miss clock president house</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(19%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic16.html>school children young work education city community boys schools training</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(10%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic14.html>house beautiful room looked drove morning car drive back lovely</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(9%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>people country world american citizens states south democracy freedom nation</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(9%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>american meeting united dr students college university group association york</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(7%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic19.html>great husband years story syndicate called interesting life lived feature</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(6%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic15.html>president state party democratic senator congress political york bill vote</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(6%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>washington time yesterday book interesting things work find read day</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
