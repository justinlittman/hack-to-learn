                     HYDE PARK, Friday
                  â€”Late yesterday evening I got back to Hyde Park, and it was hard to believe that I had only left here Tuesday morning, had gone all the way to Phoenix, Arizona, and back, seen my oldest granddaughter married and done a great many things yesterday in New York City!
Modern life certainly makes it possible to cover a great deal of ground in a short time, but I wonder if it gives us time really to appreciate all that we see and hear.
Last evening I was the opening lecturer in the course of lectures of the Institute of Arts and Sciences, which is run every summer at Columbia University. There were teachers present from all parts of the country and they were a remarkably responsive audience.

This seems to me brash beyond words. If the great powers actually decided to use joint efforts to keep the peace, the Arabs would shortly find themselves in an extremely difficult situation, even if no bombs were dropping on their heads. They know this just as well as the other powers do. It is their sense of security in the fact that the great powers will not attempt to coerce by force a weaker group of people which makes them dare to talk in the way in which the representative from Sy...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(21%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic18.html>world soviet nations united union countries war government communist peace</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(11%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>american meeting united dr students college university group association york</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(10%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic20.html>united nations world prohibited rights states part reproduction general human</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(10%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>world day park hyde year country hope people today part</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(9%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>government labor people public conditions make point question situation part</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(8%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>washington time yesterday book interesting things work find read day</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(6%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic12.html>people life man things human years read thing feel live</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
