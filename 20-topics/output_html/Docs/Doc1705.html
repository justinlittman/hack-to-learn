                     NEW YORK, Wednesday
                  â€”One cannot help feeling regretful that in retaking Seoul the United Nations forces practically will have to destroy the city. It seems to me almost like wanton destruction and the blame can be put squarely on the North Koreans. Much of the city may not be restored for when plans are made for relief and rehabilitation the most immediate aids will be directed toward helping the Koreans earn their living and to become independent.
Alas, it seemed particularly sad the other day when we learned the British, who had advanced farther than they had been expected, should have been a mistaken target for our bombers. I can imagine how our men feel and what it must have done to British morale in the sector to find themselves attacked by their own friends just as they had achieved unusual success on the ground.
These are the horrible things that happen in war and make you wish that the day will soon arrive when men can be decent enough to settle their difficulties around a table.
I have any number of people writing to me now suggesting simple ways of righting the world. However, there is always a catch in their plans somewhere, which even I can detect. It is no simple thing to find the answers to the many little questions that make up a world at peace.
One of the most gratifying things that has happened in the last few days is the choice of Dr. Ralph Bunche as the winner of the Nobel Peace Prize. No one deserves this recognition more. His patience and fairness, his refusal to be drawn either to one side or the other are what laid the foundation for peace in the Near East and made possible the negotiations that are still going on.
Dr. Bunche accepted the award with modesty saying that he was a servant and a representative of the United Nations and had acted under their orders. But, of course, the success of any policy is due largely to the man who carries it out.
This action of the Norwegian Nobel Prize Committee is very significant because it brings before the world the fact that the color of your skin has nothing to do with your ability to accomplish results in your chosen field of endeavor. That is something we need to take to heart in our country and remember when the next Congress faces the President's program on civil rights. Our Congress has taken the responsibility of turning this program down and yet the passage of civil rights measures...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(14%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic20.html>united nations world prohibited rights states part reproduction general human</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(9%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic13.html>people time york city find long good kind christmas make</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(9%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>world day park hyde year country hope people today part</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(8%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic18.html>world soviet nations united union countries war government communist peace</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(7%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic15.html>president state party democratic senator congress political york bill vote</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(7%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>american meeting united dr students college university group association york</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(6%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>people country world american citizens states south democracy freedom nation</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(6%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic6.html>men war women work service home great army red copyright</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
