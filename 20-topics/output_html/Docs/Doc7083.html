                     New York CityNEW YORK, Thursdayâ€”I came to New York City from Washington yesterday in order to keep several appointments with individuals who wanted to see me in the afternoon. In the evening I attended the executive committee meeting of the International Student Service.

Once these things have become part of my consciousness, it will be quite easy to plan for them, but just at the start it is a case of forgetfulness more than anything else. I suddenly wake up to the fact that I am doing something I have no right to do.
