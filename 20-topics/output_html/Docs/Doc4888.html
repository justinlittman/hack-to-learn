And it is understandable that those who are responsible for the safety of their nations should wonder whether the Soviets are going on with their testing in secret while we remain static.
The most recent note sent to the Soviets clearly indicates that without some agreement the rest of the world will be forced to take up testing again. As most everyone knows, testing above ground is most easily discernible, and underground testing above a certain force also is detectable, but the mere fact that on this very simple point we could get no agreement is a very discouraging development.

If we cannot get agreement on the one small phase, however, how can we hope to be able to find agreement on any of the big things?
