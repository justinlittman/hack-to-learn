                  â€”I had a very interesting visit Wednesday evening at dinner with a man who has made himself well-known in Rockland County, New York.
He told me he comes from working people, knows what a hard day's work means and therefore has no trouble with his own workers now that he has his own business, which is building roads.

Before I went out to Lake Success yesterday morning I was visited by a quite remarkable young minister,minister. His name is Rev. Richard C. Smith and many years ago I met him in Scotts Run, West Virginia. He calls the house in which he works "The Shack," but officially it is known as "The Mountaineer Mining Mission".
When I last visited there the house needed expanding, as it was bursting with its many activities. These have grown even more, and one of the things that has been added is a swimming pool. This has done more than provide recreation for the community. Considering the fact that the unions and the mine owners were contributing most of the money and that the Pursglove mining company had given the piece of land for the pool, everyone had a right to plan for its use.
