                  â€”There will be general approval of the nomination of General Eisenhower to head the armies of Western Europe. This is a tremendous organization job, but he has proved in the past his ability not only to command troops successfully in the field, but to get along with the other nationalities under his command.
This is, however, a more difficult job even than the one before. There he was organizing for war. Here he is organizing in the hope of preserving the peace. Then France was fighting a traditional enemy, Germany. Now that traditional enemy is loath to be rearmed, feeling perhaps that her only hope of survival lies in a condition of impotence which will not in any way excite the envy or fear of her neighbors either to the east or to the west.

The people are the government, or at least the ultimate authority lies in their hands because by secret ballot they choose their representatives in Congress and they choose their Chief Executive.
That was certainly an extraordinary spectacle described in yesterday morning's newspaper in which three Republican Senators voted with a solid Democratic Senate to support the President and to prevent attack upon his foreign policy. It is regrettable that this action had not come before the Republican Senators had pronounced themselves against Secretary of State Dean Acheson. None of them can have had much imagination or the mere thought of how the U.S. delegation would feel at the Brus...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(35%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic18.html>world soviet nations united union countries war government communist peace</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(22%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic15.html>president state party democratic senator congress political york bill vote</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(7%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>world day park hyde year country hope people today part</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(5%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic6.html>men war women work service home great army red copyright</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
