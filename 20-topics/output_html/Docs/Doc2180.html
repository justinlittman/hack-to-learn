                     NEW YORK, Monday.â€”Saturday was a sad day for all of us and I know that all of Fala's friends will also be sad to know that he slept away, and the little dog's story has come to an end.
Many dog lovers know the very lovely story called, "The Hound of Heaven" by Sara Addington. I like to think that Fala, like so many dogs of famous masters whose story is told in that little book, may find his five o'clock walk very pleasant.
Fala is buried near the sun dial in the rose garden which is where, many years ago, our daughter buried her first and favorite dog, Chief, who had been adored by all the family though he was always primarily her dog.

The Queen was really moved by the warm welcome given her by everyone and by the fact that many people, in spite of the rain, lined the streets to meet her. We drove down some of the back roads in order to pass through those villages that have some of the earliest Dutch houses. At Highland, however, we came back on Route 9-W, crossed the mid-Hudson bridge and went straight to my husband's grave where the Queen wanted to lay a wreath. This we did in the pouring rain.
