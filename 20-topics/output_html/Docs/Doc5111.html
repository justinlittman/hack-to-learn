I refused to speak, but agreed to answer any questions I could. The questions raised were interesting. One young man seemed to feel that because in four counties in Indiana, martial law had been declared and there had been horrible shootings and murders in other places that our whole form of democratic government was menaced.
I had to point out that we had lived through a great variety of changes in the past, and our conception of social justice had evolved year by year, and that in all probability we would live through this situation and still remain a democracy.
I was deeply impressed, however, with the earnestness of these young people, their real desire to contribute to the solution of their own problems, and to try to think through the questions before them and to consider themselves as a part of the whole situation and not as a special group.

These superintendents and their wives were here from all over the country and I was particularly delighted to see a few old friends, notably Colonel Thompson from Yosemite Park who had so kindly arranged for me a pack trip and three days camping in the High Sierras the summer before last.
