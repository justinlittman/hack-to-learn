                     Hyde Park, N. Y.HYDE PARK, Sundayâ€”My interest in the school lunch problem took up so much space that I haven't told you what I have been doing in the past few days.
I went to New York City on Thursday and had an interesting talkintalk in the afternoon with a committee of home economics teachers working in the public schools of New York City. They have a summer workshop in which they are discussing school curricula.
