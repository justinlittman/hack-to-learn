                  WASHINGTON, Friday
                     â€”Last evening we held the Congressional Reception. This is one of the largest receptions and perhaps one of the most difficult to handle with fairness to all concerned.
There was a time when several thousand people were asked to these receptions and I can remember many years ago spending well over an hour progressing up the stairs into the East Room, and even longer gradually approaching the President and his wife. In those days the entire Cabinet was lined up also to shake hands with the guests.
Now we attempt, for the sake of our guests as well as for ourselves, to limit the numbers so that the entire line can pass the President in a little more than an hour. Of course, before this administration began the custom had changed and the Cabinet members and their wives remain in the Red Room where they greet people when they come in and therefore they are not obliged to stand in line.
There are always certain people who are entitled to invitations to a reception. The Congressional Reception, for instance, includes all the members of Congress and their immediate families. Then other requests are considered.

More than a certain number, however, would mean that no one would have a pleasant evening. As it is, after the President goes up stairs,upstairs, I always go back into the dining room anddownand down the corridor to the East Room to have a look at those who are dancing and I really think it is possible for people to enjoy themselves.
This morning I am on the trail of a new "Scamper".Scamper." Our small grandson, Bill Roosevelt, who is staying here at the moment, has read and enjoyed both of my daughter's bookbooks about "Scamper" and every morning since his arrival he has demanded to know where Scamper can be found. We used to have bunnies in an enclosure at the back of the White House, but the numbers of dogs in the White House finally made it rather difficult to keep them safely apart. Now all the dogs are gone, so ...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(19%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic7.html>morning home park mrs back hyde husband family mother yesterday</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(14%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>mrs evening dinner morning mr afternoon miss clock president house</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(12%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic14.html>house beautiful room looked drove morning car drive back lovely</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(11%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic15.html>president state party democratic senator congress political york bill vote</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(9%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic13.html>people time york city find long good kind christmas make</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(9%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>government labor people public conditions make point question situation part</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(7%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>washington time yesterday book interesting things work find read day</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
