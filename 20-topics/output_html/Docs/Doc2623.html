                     HYDE PARK, Tuesday
                  â€”I have a letter today from a man who tells me he has spent nearly two years in the hospital. He has been regaining his strength, however, even though he is over 65, because he has been willing to accept work which is not the kind of highly paid job which he had in the past, but is work which interests him and is connected with the sea which he has been navigating all his life.
The Seamen's Church Institute of New York at 25 South Street is establishing a public marine museum. They learned that the Museum of the City of New York on upper Park Avenue could not display many shipmodels which they owned because of lack of space, and so the Seamen's Church Institute has allotted a quarter of the second floor of its large building to display these models as a start, and they will go on adding to these models.
My correspondent, Mr. R.E. Cropley, is spending most of his time finding models which, for lack of space, have been stored away by different shipping lines and museums. Sailors Snug Harbor unearthed a few. They are also exhibiting pictures of old clipper ships and famous sea battles. The Smithsonian InstitutInstitutione in Washington and the Mariner's Museum at Newport News, Virginia, are going to put on indefinite loan models and pictures of which they have duplicates.
The American Merchant Marine Institute, it is hoped, will help to acquire models of tankers, freighters, and passenger liners as well as tugs, ferries, harbor craft, Hudson River and Long Island Sound boats, fishing boats, etc. If anyone knows where models are stored on piers, or in the public or private attics or cellars, it would be greatly appreciated if they would inform Captain R.E. Cropley, librarian and assistant curator of the marine museum in Seaman'sSeamen's Institute of New York...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(20%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic19.html>great husband years story syndicate called interesting life lived feature</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(11%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic6.html>men war women work service home great army red copyright</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(11%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic13.html>people time york city find long good kind christmas make</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(6%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic14.html>house beautiful room looked drove morning car drive back lovely</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(6%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>people country world american citizens states south democracy freedom nation</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(5%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic20.html>united nations world prohibited rights states part reproduction general human</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(5%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic10.html>children care program health year hospital public work money medical</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(5%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>world day park hyde year country hope people today part</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
