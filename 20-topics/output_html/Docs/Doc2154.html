It is a wonderful new plant for which much of the machinery was made from surplus material salvaged and bought after the war.
Then I visited a very modern agricultural experiment station. Here, too, everything that was being done was familiar. This station must be of great use to those who are carrying on practical work in the different states and particularly to the people whom we could call extension workers who are trying to change some of the old customs and habits of the farmers in the villages.
I also stopped at a little clinic where a great many Americans and many of other foreign service groups give their services daily. UNICEF milk is dispensed to children and volunteer doctors diagnose cases and recommend treatment. Medicine is given out and some minor treatments are given on the spot.
