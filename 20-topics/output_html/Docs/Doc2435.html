                     NEW YORK, Thursday
                  —Back in New York City again and with a mountain of mail facing me and a day full of engagements. But I am afraid I won't get at any of it until Thursday night, and I must be through it by then because Friday I go to Hyde Park where I will meet, at my husband's grave, the poster child who will lay a wreath. This is done every year during the March of Dimes campaign.
It was fine to hear over the radio this morning that the bus strike here had come to an end. The people of New York City showed remarkable self-control for the duration of the strike. There was very little complaint, considering the great discomfort and difficulty many people labored under.

And there are other areas of the city where one moves at a snail's pace. Private cars may be largely to blame, but whatever the cause it seems to me that those who have been studying traffic should come up with some very real changes in the near future.
Having just come back from Washington, I am interested in passing along to you some of the things I heard.
One of the chief topics of conversation concerns the reorganization of the government, and it struck me as particularly difficult to understand. The Republican majority in Congress does not seem to want reorganization plans introduced by the President.
The President requested a continuation of the authority that Mr. Truman had to reorganize the Executive Branch of the Federal government. Under the existing law, which expires on March 31, it requires a constitutional majority—or more than half of all the members of either branch of Congress—to defeat a Presidential reorganization plan. But the House and Senate committees have decided that they prefer to be able to kill such a plan by a simple majority, which can be merely one more than...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(18%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic15.html>president state party democratic senator congress political york bill vote</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(9%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic7.html>morning home park mrs back hyde husband family mother yesterday</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(9%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic17.html>people country business great living pay money make things time</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(8%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic14.html>house beautiful room looked drove morning car drive back lovely</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(7%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>american meeting united dr students college university group association york</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(6%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>mr york good time play made copyright united feature syndicate</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(5%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>government labor people public conditions make point question situation part</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(5%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>washington time yesterday book interesting things work find read day</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(5%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>world day park hyde year country hope people today part</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
