For two days now that has been my condition, a certain amount of temperature but nothing which could serve as an excuse for the temperature and no real reason to consider oneself an invalid. This time I think it is going to wear itself out before it wears me out, for today the temperature has more or less departed, and I feel quite able to take an interest in my fellow human beings.
I came up to the surface sufficiently yesterday afternoon to discuss at some length various abstract questions of government and business, and sometimes I wonder if we believed all the pessimesticpessimistic things that we hear whether we would ever have the courage to go ahead and try anything new.
We had a family luncheon party today with only one guest but there was plenty of interest in the conversation for the guest is a gentleman with ideas and ideals and the family is always ready to argue which is conducive to conversation but which also takes up a good deal of time and before I knew it my first afternoon appointment was upon me.

Judge Kernochan's death in New York has been a blow to my husband for they were associated in many ways together. His wife was a Miss Howland whose grandmother, Madame Howland in Paris, was a connection of my husband's and much admired by both my husband and his mother.
