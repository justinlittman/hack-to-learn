                  —I spent last Wednesday night at Choate School in Wallingford, Conn., and had the pleasure of again meeting the headmaster, Mr. Seymour St. John, and his wife. The last time Mr. St. John and I met we were in Moscow. He was with a large group of educators studying Russian educational procedures and I was on my own trying to find out something about juvenile delinquency in the Soviet Union.
