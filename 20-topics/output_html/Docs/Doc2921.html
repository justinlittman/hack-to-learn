                  —My attention has been called to certain erroneous statements that appeared in an article published on July 28, 1954 in the Chicago Tribune.

But in direct quotes there is a statement by Senator Joseph McCarthy which reads as follows:
"I didn't know then that she (Judge Kenyon) was a Communist. Since then I find she was. According to the testimony of two reliable witnesses, former members of the Communist party, she was a member of the party. She had only one job—to attach herself to an individual high in public life and to influence the writing of that individual."
