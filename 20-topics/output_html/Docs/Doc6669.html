                     WASHINGTON, Thursdayâ€”We saw the newsreels of the Inauguration the night before last, and they certainly were well done. I was particularlystruck by the inaugural parade, especially the NYA, CCC, and WPA units. I wish we might have had more clearly demonstrated the various activities carried on by these organizations, for I feel sure others were as interested as I was. The pageantry of a military parade is always exciting and that part of it cannot help but be impressive.
However, as the different units marched past us and ended up with the rapid rolling by of the tanksandtanks and other military equipment, I thought of a poem which Nanette W. Barnard sent me a few days ago.
I quote it here for your consideration.

                  PEACE
I hope that what she predicts will come true and that we shall translate our "loftier purpose" into such practical ways as the consideration of the world economic situation. We must work to make it possible for people all over the world to live better and, therefore, have less reason to attack their neighbors.
We might as well face the fact that it is fundamental of human nature to want to feel secure and to be comfortable. Nobody likes being cold and hungry. If we want peace we must keep this fact constantly before us.
Yesterday afternoon, the ladies of the Fifth General Assembly of the Council of State Governments, came to tea with me. There were a few familiar faces and I was especially glad to see Miss Grace Reavu, an old friend from Albany, N. Y.
In the evening, Mr. Tom Campbell, an old friend from Montana and New Mexico, dined with us. I have rarely known anyone with a more vivid personality. He radiates enthusiasm and energy.
Mrs. Morgenthau, Anna and I are just going out to lunch with Mrs. Harold Ickes, wife of the Secretary of the Interior. This gives us a pleasant drive into the country.
