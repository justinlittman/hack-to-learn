                     NEW YORK.â€”The first thing I want to do today is thank the wives, mothers, children and sisters of the soldier-prisoners whom the Committee on Tractors for Freedom is trying to free. Most of these families are living in Miami and they have sent a number of messages expressing their gratitude to the committee. Unfortunately, I cannot thank them individually, but I can assure them that we are anxious to save all those who took part in the recent expedition against Castro.
Some of these men, of course, also took part in the Castro revolution against General Batista. And we in this country have to realize that that revolution came about because of conditions that had been allowed to continue over the years in which a large number of people of Cuba had been exploited, ignored and beaten down.
Schools that had been paid for never materialized, and those that were in existence provided only the poorest education in many cases. Health for the masses was not even thought of; housing, particularly in rural areas, was at a very low standard. People were not paid adequate wages, and discontent, misery and disease were rampant.
All these things are what bring about revolution and chaos, and these are the conditions under which the Soviets can be most effective.
A free Cuba, working for the well-being of the people, was the aim of many of the men who supported Castro, but when it became evident that one tyranny was being supplanted by another some of them began to feel again the urge for the real freedom they had hoped for and fought for. Whereupon, they deserted. And among them there well may have been people who enjoyed the benefits of the Batista regime.
It is hard to be sure that you have rooted out all that is evil, but the majority of these men were Freedom Fighters and it is right for us in the United States to feel a sense of responsibility for them.
I am very grateful for the outpouring of generosity toward the Committee on Tractors for Freedom from the people of our country. And I am also gratified by the response expressed throughout South America. It is a sign that the people of South America are being drawn closer to us here in the U.S.
In a country like ours there are bound to be differences of opinion. One cannot expect unanimity. But the vast majority of our people, I believe, not only want to help free the prisoners but are genuinely interested in making it possible for the farmers of Cuba to raise more food for the people of the island so as to improve their standard of living. We are slowly becoming aware in our country of our failures in helping to raise standards of living not only in Cuba and other Latin-Ameri...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(19%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>people country world american citizens states south democracy freedom nation</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(13%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic18.html>world soviet nations united union countries war government communist peace</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(11%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic10.html>children care program health year hospital public work money medical</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(7%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic17.html>people country business great living pay money make things time</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(7%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic6.html>men war women work service home great army red copyright</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(7%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>world day park hyde year country hope people today part</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(6%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic12.html>people life man things human years read thing feel live</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(5%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>government labor people public conditions make point question situation part</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
