                     New York CityNEW YORK, Thursdayâ€”Yesterday was a rather leisurely day in Washington. A few friends came to lunch and, at 3:00 o'clock, I went down to the Library of Congress. There, the Pan-American Coffee Bureau, presented to the division in charge of records, the recordings of my Sunday night broadcasts.
Back at the White House, I had a most interesting talk with Mr. and Mrs. Edgar Snow, who have been back from China for about a year.

They are making their own machines and gradually working away from the entirely han-made handmade dproducts. It seems to be the best foundation on which to build a better standard of living for the people.
Later, a few people came to tea and to dinner. After dinner, I went to a meeting of the Washington Newspaper Guild.

Though I have never yet had an opportunity to read it in full, I hope it will be very clearly understood and carefully discussed before its final passage.
I took the night train to New York City and began my day with an hour and a half at the dentist. Then my aunt, Mrs. Stanley Mortimer, and three of my young cousins, whom I see rather rarely, lunched with me. It was a grand family reunion.
Several people came in during the afternoon, and I spoke in the evening at a meeting for the freign foreign born, sponsored by the Civilian Defense Volunteer Office, of which Mrs. Winthrop W. Aldrich is chairman.

By then, perhaps, both tires and oil will be so well rationed, that few people will use any vehicle except for absolutely necessary work. Even if we had to drain the water out of our cars every night, I imagine we could manage.
