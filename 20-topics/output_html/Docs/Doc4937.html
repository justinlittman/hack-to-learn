                     NEW YORK.â€”I have been very much interested lately in the case of SalvatoreSalvadore Agron, the Puerto Rican boy who is under sentence of death on his conviction on two counts of murder in the first degree here in New York City. The psychiatrist who telephoned the firm of lawyers who decided to take this case, on the psychiatrist's recommendation, feels that the boy was actually psychotic when the terrible event took place which led to his conviction.
It is again a question of whether a boy of 16 should be sentenced to death in a case involving a crime motivated solely by racial hatred for non-Puerto Ricans. And also whether under these circumstances behe should have been tried by juries from which Puerto Ricans were arbitrarily excluded, contrary to the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment.

No matter how much one deplored the crime, one is also conscious of the drives in our society which can bring a child to the feelings of race hatred which existed apparently to the point of real emotional mental disturbance on the part of this youngster.
It is the society that permits situations to arise which give one group so many disadvantages to fight against and which is partly responsible in a case of this kind. It seems to me that, morally, anyone who has been the victim of a social situation should be given care by the proper authorities in an effort to recover sanity and be able to live a normal existence.
I hope the Supreme Court will direct in the future that juries, no matter what the racial or national origin of the individual, shall have a proportion of representation which equally represents the different groups of our society according to their population in the area. If the Supreme Court could see its way to making this decision or to at least discussing it so that it would be clarified and people could think it through on their state level, it would certainly tend to give us greater...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(22%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic12.html>people life man things human years read thing feel live</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(12%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>people country world american citizens states south democracy freedom nation</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(11%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic16.html>school children young work education city community boys schools training</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(10%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic15.html>president state party democratic senator congress political york bill vote</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(9%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>government labor people public conditions make point question situation part</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(5%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic10.html>children care program health year hospital public work money medical</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(5%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>world day park hyde year country hope people today part</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
