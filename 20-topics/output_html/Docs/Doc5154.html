It undoubtedly will become one if we do not let it return to its original state. Nature itself is driving the people off this land with dust storms and the absolute impossibility of making a living.
We had the pleasure of having for our guests for the night Mr. and Mrs. Axel Wenner'gren
                   of Sweden, who are sailing back to their home this week.
I spoke for a few minutes this afternoon at the annual convention of the Women's League of the United Synagogues of America. Later in the afternoon we had a musical at which the Nightingale Trio composed of Miss Louise Sandor, Miss Ivonne Ravel and Miss Nelilu Winger sang delightfully and looked as attractive as they sounded. Mr. Joseph Schuster, violoncellist, played beautifully and Mr. Peter Joray appeared in clever and amusing monologues written by Paul Horgon.
Tonight I attend the Business and Professional Women's Dinner, which will open National Business Women's Week throughout the country.
As usual, after being away one returns to a certain accumulation of neglected duties. I think there are less this time than usual. Perhaps the feeling of the warm Spring air has affected everybody and made them feel that they do not wish to do things indoors.
We will probably have less and less attention in the way of visits and letters, as people are more and more tempted to watch Spring come out of doors. It is hard to believe that only two days ago we passed through a heavy snow stormsnowstorm and saw winter taking his last fling.
