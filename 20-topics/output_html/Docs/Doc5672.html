                  DANVILLE, Ill., Wednesday
                     â€”Our train journeys these days are short, but nevertheless the days seem to pass very quickly. Mrs. Vrooman saw us off this morning at nine-thirty, and the police met us in Danville at eleven-thirty.

Hawes, who is county W.P.A.WPA Director, I have been to visit two W.P.A.WPA nursery schools; one for white children and one for colored children.
The one for white children is housed in the basement of a large school, and while it is not built for the purpose, there is plenty of sun and air and space and there is a park nearby for play.
The one for colored children is in a small frame building which belongs to a colored women's club. It is in a good location where there are plenty of children in the neighboring houses to attend, but the best one can say for it is that there is space for play at the back. The children get a good lunch, cod liver oil twice a day and the requisite amount of orange juice and milk. A coal stove in the one room which is available for eating, sleeping and playing, makes it too hot even on winter...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(15%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic16.html>school children young work education city community boys schools training</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(15%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic14.html>house beautiful room looked drove morning car drive back lovely</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(15%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic11.html>land told small country good part area farm food visited</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(13%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>washington time yesterday book interesting things work find read day</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(9%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>mrs evening dinner morning mr afternoon miss clock president house</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(8%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic13.html>people time york city find long good kind christmas make</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
