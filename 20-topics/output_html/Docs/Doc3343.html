                  â€”A most delightful Christmas party was given the other day by the Secretariat of the United Nations. Called "Christmas Around the World," it was a charming pageant that started off with the Swedish Feast of Lights and a Santa Lucia procession, to be followed by the introduction of the grandfather of all Santa Clauses from Holland.
