                     PHILADELPHIA.—I would like to begin this article by paying tribute to the Soviet people with whom we associated, first as an invited delegation from the American Association for the United Nations and later as tourists when Dr. David Gurewitsch and I came under the auspices of the exchange committee for the advancement of cultural exchange between foreign countries and the Soviet Union.
Dr. and Mrs. Gurewitsch and I were in the Soviet Union through a period of very high tension. We talked to many people in important positions, but they never showed us the slightest personal antagonism and always they refrained from asking questions which would have been embarrassing for us and would have inevitably led us into fruitless arguments.
In order to have a profitable argument we must acknowledge that both sides have certain premises that they need to change. That is impossible for the Soviets and not so easy for us, so actually we have to save our breath when we are citizens without power to change the situation, and try to devote ourselves to developing warm feelings toward each other as individuals. That, I hope, we succeeded in doing.
Now for some of the changes that strike you on a return visit after a year's absence. One year ago driving in from the airport to our hotel in Moscow we saw practically only trucks on the road. This year, while there is no traffic comparable to what you find in Paris, London, or New York, there was a large number of small cars on the road and a considerable number of larger cars—all of them of Russian make.
We looked as we approached the University of Moscow for the sea of cranes which had greeted our eyes last year, when we had been told that every two cranes meant an apartment house being built. Instead the apartment houses were all built. The city extended solidly beyond the university on one side of the road and on the other side the cranes were up and apartment houses that would, when finished, house 2,000,000 peopelpeople were on their way.
As always, the Soviet Union is a country of contrasts, and one finds a collective farm beginning where the new apartment houses end. Cows lie peacefully under the shadow of new apartment houses, feeling secure in their surroundings which by another year may be completely changed!
Last year it never occurred to me—though there was a table at the Hotel National which was kept and filled at all times by young Chinese—that the progress made in the Soviet Union might be paralleled by the progress in Communist China or that it might be even greater in China.
This year I noticed that Premier Nikita Khrushchev's notes were gone over by the Chinese Ambassador who traveled to Yalta to consult with him. This may or may not be important, but it might mean a considerable rise in power of the Communist Chinese. If so, this fact may be important for our negotiators to consider. Six hundred million Chinese so close to the Soviet border may give pause to Mr. Khrushchev. At this moment a settlement with the West may have some attraction, for even in th...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(21%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic18.html>world soviet nations united union countries war government communist peace</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(12%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic12.html>people life man things human years read thing feel live</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(9%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic14.html>house beautiful room looked drove morning car drive back lovely</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(7%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic17.html>people country business great living pay money make things time</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(7%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic13.html>people time york city find long good kind christmas make</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(7%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>people country world american citizens states south democracy freedom nation</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(7%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>world day park hyde year country hope people today part</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(6%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>government labor people public conditions make point question situation part</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(6%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>american meeting united dr students college university group association york</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
