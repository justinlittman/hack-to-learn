                     WASHINGTON, Tuesday—Yesterday afternoon I had the pleasure of welcoming the new Canadian Ambassador, Mr. L. B. Pearson, and Mrs. Pearson at tea. At luncheon we had a chance to discuss some of Miss Katharine Lenroot's concerns, and today she is off to join the others attending the conference in Mexico City.
This should prove a most interesting and important conference for all of us who are anxious to see the nations in this hemisphere walk hand in hand toward greater development and understanding.
There is shortly going to be held in Washington, under the auspices of the National Education Association, a conference on veterans' education.
