The men sitting around the room were an impressive-looking group—fine faces, strong personalities, and for the most part they were men who knew many parts of the world, for they came from 17 different nations.

Being a nation of many resources, Iran is getting much help from the U.N. in finding ways to help expand and accelerate what would otherwise have been done more slowly. The U.N. provides the kind of technical knowledge that can only be achieved by bringing together training and background from many nationalities.
