                     JACKSONVILLE, Fla., March 23
                  â€”I woke this morning, looked out of my train window to see palm trees, orange groves and lovely flowers all around. To be transported suddenly into summer was a curious sensation. I had noticed, for the first time, as we came out of Washington, the reddish look on the willow trees, which means that Spring is really at hand.

                  Governor David Sholtz of Florida, and President Hamilton Holt of Rollins College, met us at at Winter Park. We went at once to the lovely chapel, given by Mrs. Edward Bok, where the exercises were to held. The heads of all the higher educational institutions in the State took part in the ceremony.
I have seen my husband receive a number of degrees, but is was the first time he had ever seen me in cap and gown and he promptly incorporated that in his speech.
After my husband left, my brother and some friends motored me up to Jacksonville and on the way we drove from Daytona to OrmendOrmond on the beach. The most beautiful beach I have ever seen before is the one at San Diego, California, but I have never driven on one at the rate of speed at which my brother drives. It was both pleasant and exciting, the sea looked beautiful and the sand inviting. How envious I felt of all the people under little leaf umbrellas.
I am very grateful for my glimpse of the beach and also of St. Augustine, a city I have long wished to see. Now I am in Jacksonville to make my speech tonight, and then I take the 11 o'clock plane back to Washington.
