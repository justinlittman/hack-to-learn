                  —Poor Senator McCarthy! He must be feeling much in need of support.
One of his ardent backers has just sent me a clipping of a newspaper article written by William SF. Buckley, Jr., co-author of the book, "McCarthy and His Enemies." In one paragraph of this article, it is interesting to find the famous Dreyfus case dragged in and McCarthy likened to Dreyfus.
