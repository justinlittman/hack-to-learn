                     NEW YORK.—What is the difference between Israel and its surrounding states?
Israel is a tiny country and its neighbors should not be afraid of it, but they are. Before long, it is said, the inflow of immigration will necessitate expansion of Israeli territory. Many do not like to acknowledge it, but history has shown that the Israel army, though small, is highly efficient and, above everything, the people of Israel have something to fight for—homes, dreams of development that they see coming true year by year.
Nevertheless, there are plenty of problems in Israel. Every Israeli is not a hero. It takes time to convert some of those who come from other countries to the ideal of working for Israel. Sometimes they must take up occupations they had never before considered worthy of their consideration. Yet, they now find themselves succeeding under dynamic leadership and guidance.
There is an atmosphere in Israel that one doesn't find in many other countries. Its young people are partly responsible for it. They are excited by the dream of building a country. They are willing to work with their full youthful energy to achieve unbelievable results.
But the young could not do this alone. Israel's population is drawn from 100 different countries. Some of these countries are highly modern, highly organized with trained administrators. These are the men who are used in government and, what is perhaps more important, these are the men and women who direct individual projects.
They have imagination, they know how to handle people, and they have plenty of experience in adjusting themselves to the handling of people of different backgrounds, different religions and different customs. Where there are so many different native tongues, Hebrew has to be learned to weld the country together, and it is learned by young and old alike.
Above everything else, I think Israel's good fortune lies in its top leaders. Premier David Ben-Gurion knows how to capture the imagination of the young; how to make them willing to leave well established, easy living in an old kibbutz or a good job and give themselves to establishing a new kibbutz or to face the incredible hardships in the Negev. Or he may urge them to move to a new and growing town, which is still raw and in formation, and give their knowledge of organization and admin...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(22%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic18.html>world soviet nations united union countries war government communist peace</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(11%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>people country world american citizens states south democracy freedom nation</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(8%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>government labor people public conditions make point question situation part</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(8%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic3.html>world day park hyde year country hope people today part</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(7%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic1.html>american meeting united dr students college university group association york</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(7%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic16.html>school children young work education city community boys schools training</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(7%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic12.html>people life man things human years read thing feel live</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(6%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic17.html>people country business great living pay money make things time</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
