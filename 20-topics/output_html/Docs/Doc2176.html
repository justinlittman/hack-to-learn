                     HYDE PARK, Wednesday
                  â€”Settling down again here and preparing for the forth-comingforthcomingweek endweekend with Queen Juliana of the Netherlands, I find myself reflecting on my first two days back in the country, which were Sunday and Monday, following my speedy and event-filled round-the-world trip home from Paris.
