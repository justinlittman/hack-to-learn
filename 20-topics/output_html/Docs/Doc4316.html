                     SEATTLE, WashSEATTLE.â€”Much of my time on this striptrip has been taken up with long daytime flights as well as some late-night flying, but we have been fortunate to have good flying weather and no delays.
The other day at Ricks College, the Mormon institution at Rexburg, Idaho, we were privileged to sit in on a drama class and enjoyed every minute of it. I was told that two of three ofor the students really hope to become professional actors and that the others probably will use what they learn in their later teaching.
There also is a fairly strong musical interest among the students at Ricks, and this, too, is largely in preparation for their teaching careers.

And Miss Corr told me that some of the people around her, when I mentioned in my talk the Soviet reaction to the Little Rock incident, looked at each other in surprise and murmured, "What was that incident?"
