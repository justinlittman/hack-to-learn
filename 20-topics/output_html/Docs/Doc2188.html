                     NEW YORK, Wednesday
                  â€”It is most depressing day after day to read in the papers of the loss caused by floods in the Mississippi and Missouri river areas. This has been happening year after year, and I can remember how the National Resources Board and my husband tried to make plans that would eventually mean not only control of these waters but the use of these waters for the benefit of the people of these areas.
Capturing and diverting the flood waters for the good of the people, of course, would mean heavy initial expenditures but why are we so shortsighted that we cannot see that the accumulation of loss over the years has been far greater than any expenditure which would stop this loss? All I can surmise is that our Congress is thinking selfishly in terms of being able to make a record for economy and of shifting the responsibility to somebody else for making a decision to spend the money now.
