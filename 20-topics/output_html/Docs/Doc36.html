                  â€”I have a letter from a friend which says: "I am seriously disturbed by the rising tide of criticism about our two chief Allies in the war, Russia and Great Britain."
This letter points up something which a number of people seem to feel, for I have read editorials on the subject of the amount of common gossip which one can hear in almost any gathering of people today. Frequently it is said that this type of gossip is started deliberately as enemy propaganda, and anyone who is familiar with "Tokyo Rose" in the Pacific knows that many rumors start from her broadcasts.
