                     NEW YORK, Friday
                  —I have been having the pleasure recently of meeting a number of the women whom I met while I was in Japan.
One charming young woman attended the Summer Institute at Harvard. Now, she is taking a year's leave from her work in Japan and is going to Bryn Mawr College to study human relationships, particularly those between men and women.
You may smile at this idea but, if you lived in Japan, it would not be a matter for amusement. The pattern of Japanese life is changing, and women who were merely immured in their husband's homes, ran the household, bore the children and took care of them until they were old enough to be taken over by the men, are now realising that they may be factors—in different ways—for good in the life of the country.
In the farming areas the women always did a large amount of the work in the fields, in addition to household tasks, but they were not treated as equals by the men.

Madame Sumiko Tanaka is young and full of charm. She wears her native costume most of the time, but she would look appropriately dressed in Western costume too. She is intelligent, with a remarkable command of the English language, and I feel sure she will not only benefit by her time here, but will do much for the relationship between Japan and the United States if she is able to meet a great many people while she is here.
I took Miss Tanaka, with two other friends, to see Shirley Booth in "By the Beautiful Sea".." This play gives you a pleasant evening. The book and the music are agreeable, and Shirley Booth is excellent, but it is one of those plays in which Americans make fun of themselves in the past, and the picture of Coney Island is not exactly accurate. Miss Tanaka enjoyed herself and was amused. However, when I heard her murmur: "Now I know what Coney Island is like," I thought I had better tell h...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(18%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>people country world american citizens states south democracy freedom nation</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(10%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic6.html>men war women work service home great army red copyright</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(9%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic19.html>great husband years story syndicate called interesting life lived feature</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(9%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic11.html>land told small country good part area farm food visited</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(8%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic14.html>house beautiful room looked drove morning car drive back lovely</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(8%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>mrs evening dinner morning mr afternoon miss clock president house</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(7%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic5.html>washington time yesterday book interesting things work find read day</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(5%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>mr york good time play made copyright united feature syndicate</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
