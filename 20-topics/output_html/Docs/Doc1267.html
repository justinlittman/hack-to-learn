                  â€”The convention on Freedom of Information submitted by the United Kingdom is slowly being considered in Committee No. 3. Our chairman made a plea to everybody this morning to curtail speeches and hurry the work as much as possible, since the target date for the close of the present session of the United Nations has been set by President Evatt for May 14.

All the arguments in favor of it are made to sound very virtuous and plausible. The amendment, however, could be used to make it impossible for anyone to send out a story which displeased the government of the country where a correspondent happened to be stationed, so we and many other nations oppose it.
Mayor William O'Dwyer has named this week "Good WillGoodwill Week" in honor of the Good WillGoodwill Industries. This organization collects materials and articles of every kind which their workers, who are often old or handicapped people, renovate and concertconvert into useful articles. It is a source of income to the workers who might otherwise have no income and, at the same time, it builds their morale and gives them an interest in life.
