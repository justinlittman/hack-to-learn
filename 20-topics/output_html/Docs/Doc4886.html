                     WASHINGTON.—I have been on a very rapid jump from one coast to the other. Last Monday night I was in Phoenix, Ariz., and was interested to find that much curiosity exists about Tractors for Freedom. Apparently many Arizona newspapers have carried only adverse points of view on our effort to free the Cuban invaders from Premier Castro.
One reason for this, I suppose, is Mr. Barry Goldwater. Another is a general Republican trend in the people themselves in that area.
The feeling on the part of a number of people, however, is that there must be some other side to the picture. I explained with care that there are always two points of view on everything, and that it is wise to hear both in order to decide for oneself how one feels. Of course, one can only do this after having been exposed to the whole picture.
Sen. Barry Goldwater is a charming and delightful man, and he undoubtedly believes in his point of view. In this connection I read in Wednesday morning's newspapers that he had stated the spending programs and fiscal policy of the New Frontier are "playing right into the hands of the Kremlin leaders whose determination has long been to bleed America white."
This speech was given at the luncheon on Tuesday of the Sales Executives Club in New York and attended by 1,200 people. An official of the club said this was the largest attendance at any luncheon in the club's history, so this particular group must have wanted to hear Senator Goldwater and his ideas very much indeed.
There probably are not many people who still remember that in the Hoover campaign in 1932, when the banks were failing and employment was at the lowest possible ebb, we were told that if my husband, who was the Democratic nominee running against Mr. Hoover, was elected, the collapse of our whole economy would come, we would be completely impoverished, and grass would grow in our streets. Somehow I was reminded of this by Senator Goldwater's remarks.
"Believe me," he said, "it will make no difference if we are the best-educated, best-clothed and best-fed people in the world, if our economic underpinnings are compromised."
One cannot help wondering whether the Senator believes that people who are all these things will allow their economic underpinnings to be compromised.
If you are well-fed and well-clothed you must have earned the wherewithal to buy the food and clothes, and so the farmers would be better off and the manufacturers would be better off. If you are better housed, you would have employed a great many people in construction all over the country. This would give money to spend and put it in circulation. If, by chance, you are the best-educated people in the world—and educated not as the Germans were but on real democratic and humanitarian p...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(18%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic17.html>people country business great living pay money make things time</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(17%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>government labor people public conditions make point question situation part</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(14%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic15.html>president state party democratic senator congress political york bill vote</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(7%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>people country world american citizens states south democracy freedom nation</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(6%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic11.html>land told small country good part area farm food visited</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(5%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic20.html>united nations world prohibited rights states part reproduction general human</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
