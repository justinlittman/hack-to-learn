                     NEW YORK, Friday
                  —Some of the newspapers I saw in California treated the Hungarian coup almost as though it were an immediate cause for war. I wish that we might be a little more temperate even in the speeches made in our Senate.
I think it is quite correct to ask the United Nations to make an investigation as to whether any nation has used undue influence over the political actions of another nation, particularly when there is an occupation army in the smaller nation in question. But prejudging the results of an inquiry seems to me a mistake and it cannot help but make the inquiry, if it is decided upon, more difficult.

It seems to me that matters have come to a point where it is imperative that the heads of the great nations meet again.

The heads of great nations should meet and take into consideration a world view of economic, political and moral questions.
The California State Democratic Committee's dinner which I attended in Los Angeles was apparently very successful. There is one great advantage in having political parties in Los Angeles—you can offer your guests the necessary speech-making sugar-coated by entertainment from Hollywood. At the dinner, Danny Kaye, Frank Sinatra and Dinah Shore were all on hand. Even though I had to provide part of the evening's more serious entertainment, still I enjoyed the real entertainment probably mo...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(23%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic18.html>world soviet nations united union countries war government communist peace</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(12%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic20.html>united nations world prohibited rights states part reproduction general human</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(12%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic8.html>government labor people public conditions make point question situation part</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(11%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic4.html>mr york good time play made copyright united feature syndicate</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(9%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic15.html>president state party democratic senator congress political york bill vote</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(9%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic2.html>mrs evening dinner morning mr afternoon miss clock president house</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(5%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic6.html>men war women work service home great army red copyright</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
