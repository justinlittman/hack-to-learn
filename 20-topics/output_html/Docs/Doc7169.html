                     Hyde parkHYDE PARK, Sundayâ€”My days have been decidedly peaceful here, though full of activity from the point of view of doing things with the children, swimming and playing games. There is a real touch of autumn in the air. Around the pond, the purple weed has turned to a faint reddish tinge. Here and there some scarlet leaves are showing on the swamp maples.
