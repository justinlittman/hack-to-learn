                     NEW YORK.â€”Anyone who watched and listened to the new delegate to the United Nations from Iraq must have been interested to hear him remark that no blood had been shed in their taking over of the government. When reminded that three leaders had died, he made rather light of it and said that was only due to their own action not to those who brought about the coup d'etat!
Then we read in the newspapers the other morning that "an Iraqi Army officer" threatened the life of the representative of the pre-revolutionary government of Iraq to the United Nations.
This does not sound so peaceful, and it does not look as though any of the governments under the influence of the Soviet Union are being very peaceful.

One suggestion that I read proposed that the Security Council nominate a subcommittee to which the heads of Great Britain, France, the United States, the Soviet Union, and India would be appointed. This would certainly accomplish the result of calling together the heads of nations for a summit conference.
It will be interesting to the women of our country to see that the Assistant Chairman of the Republican National Committee, Bertha S. Adkins, has been nominated by the President to be Under Secretary of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare. She has had some experience as Dean of Women in two colleges, and since I hope that women in the United States are deeply interested in the basic changes needed in our educational system, this appointment may prove to be one of the very im...</textarea><br><br>Top topics in this doc (% words in doc assigned to this topic) <br><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(28%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic18.html>world soviet nations united union countries war government communist peace</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(17%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic15.html>president state party democratic senator congress political york bill vote</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(8%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic6.html>men war women work service home great army red copyright</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(7%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic20.html>united nations world prohibited rights states part reproduction general human</a> ...</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>(6%)</td><td><a href=../Topics/Topic9.html>people country world american citizens states south democracy freedom nation</a> ...</td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br><br><a href=../all_topics.html><b>[Index]</b></a></body></html>
