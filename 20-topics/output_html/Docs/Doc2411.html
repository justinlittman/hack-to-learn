One of my very firmest resolutions was that I would have hours of leisure in these coming months but, as I look at my calendar for January and February, it seems to have filled up so rapidly that I don't think I am going to have the leisure hours I had counted on.
Oh, well! Perhaps I wouldn't like them if I had them, so the best New Year's resolution is to be content with whatever comes and to face cheerfully a world in which there will undoubtedly be no security and a great deal of uncertainty for months to come, if not for years.

The latter states so well what Senator Lehman stands for in our community and in the U.S. that I would like to quote from it, as follows:
"...exceptional contributions to the welfare and security of the United States and the advancement of mankind's struggle for freedom and dignity. Senator Lehman's long and eminent career of high public service has been marked by a deep-laid awareness of the needs of both the present and the future. He has shown a profound understanding of humanity's hopes and aspirations.
